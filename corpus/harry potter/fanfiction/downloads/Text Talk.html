  <u>Monday AM</u>
</p><p>(10:30) <strong>How much do you reckon McGonagall will kill me for flooding her office?</strong></p><p>(10:32) <em>Who is McGonagall? And personally, I don’t receive well with having my own things flooded.</em></p><p>(10:33) <strong>What do you mean who’s McGonagall? How hard did Lily hit you this time? She’s only the love of my life.</strong></p><p>(10:34) <strong>Oh shit. New phone. Wrong number. Sorry.</strong></p><p>(10:35) <em>I figured. It’s ok. But if she’s the love of your life, why are you flooding her office?</em></p><p>(10:40) <strong>She’s not really the love of my life. She’s my professor and head of house. I’d like to think we have some unrequited love though.</strong></p><p>(10:41) <em>I get the vague impression she deals with a lot of shit with you.</em></p><p>(10:41) <strong>…yeah, but she secretly loves it.</strong></p><p>(10:41) <em>In that case, I’ll leave you two to it.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Monday PM</u>
</p><p>(3:45) <strong>I got 3 months detention and 24 death threats.</strong></p><p>(3:46) <em>Wrong number again.</em></p><p>(3:46) <strong>No no, I’m updating you. I flooded an entire floor of dormitories. It was brilliant.</strong></p><p>(3:47) <em>Not to be mean, Random Stranger Who Texted the Wrong Number, but don’t you have friends you can tell this to?</em></p><p>(3:47) <em>Also, floor of dormitories? Where the hell are you?</em></p><p>(3:38) <strong>All my friends were there, Random Stranger Who Keeps Replying.</strong></p><p>(3:38) <strong>I’m at boarding school. Don’t get the wrong impression though, I’m totally punk rock.</strong></p><p>(3:40) <em>Anyone who has to say they are punk rock are entirely not punk rock at all.</em></p><p>(3:40) <strong>Whatever. I’m punk rock. I don’t need to prove myself to you.</strong></p><p>(3:41) <em>Well don’t get all sulky now. Why did you flood your professor’s office?</em></p><p>(3:41) <strong>It wasn’t her office I was aiming for, but unfortunately it’s on the same floor as certain persons dorm rooms.</strong></p><p>(3:41) <strong>They were the target. Simply bc they’re dicks.</strong></p><p>(3:45) <em>You sound a bit like a dick.</em></p><p>(3:47) <strong>We’ve gone through this. I’m punk rock.</strong></p><p>(3:53) <strong>I have to go to my first detention now. Good bye stranger.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Wednesday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(12:07) <em>Do they have decent food at boarding school?</em></p><p>(12:10) <strong>Hello to you too. Thanks for consoling me on my detention journey.</strong></p><p>(12:10) <em>Drama queen. Come on. Food. Good?</em></p><p>(12:13) <strong>Not really. Unless you like to eat cardboard and meat mashups.</strong></p><p>(12:14) <em>Meat mashup sounds interesting.</em></p><p>(12:15) <strong>Not until there’s no longer meat in the meat mashup and it’s just pulverized peas and gravy and breadcrumbs.</strong></p><p>(12:16) <em>Is that what you’re having now?</em></p><p>(12:16) <strong>Right now I have a juice box bc I don’t trust what’s in the soup. Last time there was a sock.</strong></p><p>(12:16) <strong>And I wasn’t even the one who put it there.</strong></p><p>(12:17) <em>Are juice boxes punk rock?</em></p><p>(12:17) <strong>Duck off Ads hole.</strong></p><p>(12:17) <em>WOW.</em></p><p>(12:18) <strong>ARGH. IT’S A NEW PHONE. **FUCK OFF ARSEHOLE.</strong></p><p>(12:18) <em>Amazing. The eloquence.</em></p><p>(12:18) <strong>I guess your lunch is better than mine, is it?</strong></p><p>(12:19) <em>I thought it wouldn’t be, but you’ve proven me wrong. I have pumpkin soup and jelly. It was either this or sandwiches made of sponges.</em></p><p>(12:20) <strong>Jelly? Are you 5?</strong></p><p>(12:21) <em>Bugger off. Don’t be jelly of my jelly.</em></p><p>(12:21) <strong>You didn’t</strong></p><p>(12:22) <em>I did and will now see myself out. Have fun with detention tonight.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Wednesday PM</u>
</p><p>(1:01) You were texting at lunch but me and Pete were right there.</p><p>(1:01) You don’t have other friends.</p><p>(1:02) <strong>How dare you, I have a whole plethora of acquaintances that I can call upon when your ugly arse does not deliver.</strong></p><p>(1:03) Liar.</p><p>(1:10) Oh come on, you’re not ignoring me now.</p><p>(1:11) <strong>Did I need to respond to something?</strong></p><p>(1:11) Don’t play idiot. You do that naturally enough.</p><p>(1:12) <strong>The wrong number I texted the other day. They asked if boarding school food was any good.</strong></p><p>(1:13) They know you go to boarding school? Did you also give them your blood type and home address?</p><p>(1:13) <strong>Dude.</strong></p><p>(1:14) What about your DNA sequence? Make it easier for them to just clone you.</p><p>(1:14) <strong>What are you even on about.</strong></p><p>(1:15) It’s just weird that this random knows you go to a boarding school.</p><p>(1:15) <strong>You’re just overreacting, man. They don’t know which boarding school I go to. They don’t even know my name. I don’t their name. Shit, idek their gender.</strong></p><p>(1:16) Whatever, Pads. Just don’t get murdered, yeah?</p><p>(1:17) I don’t want to have to bury your body. You’re too fuckin heavy, man.</p><p>(1:17) <strong>Thank you for caring.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(1:15) <strong>Hey, what’s your name?</strong></p><p>(1:18) <em>Not happening.</em></p><p>(1:18) <strong>Is that what your mother calls you?</strong></p><p>(1:19) <em>No, but at the same time she does call me Pumpkin and Sweetheart, does not mean that’s my name either.</em></p><p>(1:20) <strong>You’ve opened a door here, Sweetheart, that you probably shouldn’t have.</strong></p><p>(1:20) <em>Shit.</em></p><p>(1:21) <strong>What about gender then? Boy, girl, in between, both, none, come on.</strong></p><p>(1:22) <em>Are you putting me on Craigslist?</em></p><p>(1:23) <em>Ok fine, I’m a boy.</em></p><p>(1:30) <em>Is this a disappointing establishment?</em></p><p>(1:40) <em>Whatever.</em></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Thursday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:04) <strong>I got my phone taken off me. Sorry.</strong></p><p>(9:17) <strong>C’mon. You’re not mad, right? What for?</strong></p><p>(9:30) <em>Were you texting in class?</em></p><p>(9:34) <strong>Ah, yeah, and I’m doing it again.</strong></p><p>(9:40) <em>Such a waste.</em></p><p>(9:41) <strong>Shut up. It’s history. Boring.</strong></p><p>(9:42) <em>What are you learning?</em></p><p>(9:43) <strong>French Revolution. So much forehead.</strong></p><p>(9:46) <em>J'aime la Révolution française! remet-toi au travail, connard.</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>Oh my god I should have known you were one of those people. I don’t even have google translate but I’m pretty sure you just swore at me.</strong></p><p>(9:48) <em>Hardly.</em></p><p>(9:50) <strong>I bet you sweet talk all the girls with your French.</strong></p><p>(9:50) <em>Are you a girl?</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>No. Is this a disappointing establishment?</strong></p><p>(9:51) <strong>Honestly, what was up with that?</strong></p><p>(9:52) <em>Nothing. Never mind.</em></p><p>(9:53) <strong>No, c’mon you were pissed.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>I just thought that… you would stop talking to me if you knew I wasn’t a girl. Because I assumed you were a bloke. And that maybe</em></p><p>(9:55) <em>I dunno. Forget it.</em></p><p>(9:55) <strong>Did you think I would stop texting you bc you weren't a girl and therefor would not want to interact with you bc obviously I AM A HETERO SEX FIEND?</strong></p><p>(9:56) <em>That’s… a strange way of putting it. But yeah, something like that.</em></p><p>(10:00) <em>Now isn’t the time to go silent.</em></p><p>(10:01) <strong>IM SORRU IN JUSY LAUDJING SP HARD YOU ARW AN IDOT OG MYGOS</strong></p><p>(10:01) <em>Thank you. Thank you so much.</em></p><p>(10:02) <strong>You’re an idiot. I like you. Not enough to get my phone confiscated again though. I’ll talk to you later, Pumpkin.</strong></p><p>(10:02) <em>T'es con.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Thursday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(12:32) <strong>What do you do when your best mate is being a dickhead but no amount of explanation (including diagrams) will convince him that he is being a dickhead?</strong></p><p>(12:35) <em>Resort to physical violence, I imagine.</em></p><p>(12:35) <strong>Ok, let’s narrow it. He’s being a dickhead about a girl.</strong></p><p>(12:36) <em>My suggestion still stands.</em></p><p>(12:37) <strong>I’VE TRIED. MAN HAVE I TRIED.</strong></p><p>(12:37) <em>Is your friend and this girl dating?</em></p><p>(12:38) <strong>No. He just pines.</strong></p><p>(12:38) <em>Then I think he’s being punished enough, hm?</em></p><p>(12:39) <strong>You’d think so, but in between the pining is bursts of ‘SHE LOOKED AT ME’ and ‘SHE DIDN’T SWEAR AT ME TODAY’. He’s too happy to be unhappy.</strong></p><p>(12:40) <em>I admire his optimism.</em></p><p>(12:41) <em>Are you jealous of his pining?</em></p><p>(12:42) <strong>NO WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT</strong></p><p>(12:43) <em>WELL YOUR ALARMED REACTION SEEMS TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE.</em></p><p>(12:45) <strong>It’s not jealously. Just annoying maybe.</strong></p><p>(12:45) <strong>And idk, he just seems so sure that she’s ‘the one’. Although he’s never said those words. He’s an idiot, not a sap.</strong></p><p>(12:46) <em>I don’t follow. Why does your friend having found ‘the one’ make you annoyed?</em></p><p>(12:47) <strong>You’re gonna make me say it, aren’t you?</strong></p><p>(12:47) <em>????? Yes.</em></p><p>(12:48) <strong>Bc maybe I would like to find ‘the one’ also. And I’m annoyed bc he seems to have found it so easily. This is stupid.</strong></p><p>(12:48) <em>How old are you?</em></p><p>(12:49) <strong>How dare you! You cannot simply just ask a lady her age! The travesty!</strong></p><p>(12:53) <strong>Ok, I’m 17.</strong></p><p>(12:54) <em>I’m no expert, but I’m pretty sure it’s completely natural to not have found ‘the one’ at age 17.</em></p><p>(12:54) <strong>Doesn’t make it suck any less.</strong></p><p>(12:54) <em>Just do what every other teenage boy does.</em></p><p>(12:55) <strong>Do I want to ask…</strong></p><p>(12:56) <em>;-)</em></p><p>(12:57) <strong>I’m terminating now. We’ve reached a weird level.</strong></p><p>(12:57) <em>But seriously, don’t worry about not finding the one. It’ll work out eventually.</em></p><p>(12:58) <strong>And until then, your suggestion is wanking.</strong></p><p>(12:59) <em>I’m also 17, not a psychologist.</em></p><p>(12:59) <strong>Yeah, but you don’t have to share a dorm with two other blokes.</strong></p><p>(1:00) <em>No, but I do share a sleeping space with five other people.</em></p><p>(1:00) <em>That is why the world invented toilets.</em></p><p>(1:00) <strong>I’ll be sure to remember that. In the mean time, I’m going to go to Chemistry now and not think about wanking for fear of something embarrassing happening. I’ll miss you, Darling Pie.</strong></p><p>(1:01) <em>Those two sentences should not be next to each other.</em></p><p>*</p><p>

  <u>Sunday PM</u>
</p><p>(2:43) <strong>So, drunken me has saved your number as ‘Pumpkin Tit’ and I think we need to rectify this.</strong></p><p>(2:43) <strong>Mostly bc my mate Prongs thinks it’s a little offensive.</strong></p><p>(2:44) <em>Why do I doubt it was ‘drunk you’ that named the contact Pumpkin Tit?</em></p><p>(2:44) <em>Is it possibly because ‘sober you’ refers to your friend as ‘Prongs’?</em></p><p>(2:45) <em>By Jove I think it is!</em></p><p>(2:45) <strong>Shut up, it’s a well established nickname.</strong></p><p>(2:46) <strong>And if you don’t tell me your real name, I’ll have to nickname you too. Maybe something that isn’t Pumpkin Tit.</strong></p><p>(2:47) <em>What’s your nickname, then?</em></p><p>(2:47) <strong>Padfoot.</strong></p><p>(2:48) <em>Are you in a gang? Is this an initiation?</em></p><p>(2:48) <strong>Do you want to be forever known as Pumpkin Tit???</strong></p><p>(2:49) <em>Well, no…</em></p><p>(2:50) <strong>Then describe yourself. Give me something to base the name off.</strong></p><p>(2:51) <em>Did you come up with Padfoot and Prongs?</em></p><p>(2:51) <strong>Yep. And Wormtail.

Did you use the Wormtail approach?</p><p>(11:04) <strong>Yes, and I’m going to kill the little rat bc I was right.</strong></p><p>(11:05) You’re always right, Padfoot.</p><p>(11:05) <strong>Hell yeah I am.</strong></p><p>(11:06) You’re almost like a genius… so smart and intelligent…</p><p>(11:06) <strong>I’m going to agree here but I am cautious…</strong></p><p>(11:07) Can you help me with the Trig work? I zoned out while he was speaking and now I don’t know what’s going on.</p><p>(11:07) <strong>You know this happens when you sit behind Lily.</strong></p><p>(11:08) I wasn’t strong enough today.</p><p>(11:09) <strong>Fine.

I’ll alert the authorities.</strong></p><p>(2:24) <em>Should I be preparing myself for drunk texting again?</em></p><p>(2:25) <strong>Oh come on. I do once, and now it’s a ‘thing’?</strong></p><p>(2:25) <em>Just wondering if I should prepare my answers for the inevitable 20 questions.</em></p><p>(2:26) <strong>I’ve already found out the important bits.</strong></p><p>(2:26) <em>Virginity and health status?</em></p><p>(2:27) <strong>Precisely. Do you have low expectations, will you withstand my prowess?</strong></p><p>(2:27) <em>Easy tiger, I seem to recall that your expectations meet mine.</em></p><p>(2:28) <strong>That’s even better; we’ll both have no clue what’s happening, so who does it hurt?</strong></p><p>(2:28) <em>I don’t know how to tell you this, but two men together who have no idea what to do is likely to hurt A LOT.</em></p><p>(2:28) <strong>Bit of saliva will fix it all up.</strong></p><p>(2:29) <em>Oh wow. I’m actually, genuinely worried now for your future partners.</em></p><p>(2:30) <strong>Stay calm, Moony, the school has a pamphlet system here so they don’t have to actually teach us about sex.</strong></p><p>(2:30) <em>Pamphlets?? That’s all you get???</em></p><p>(2:31) <strong>There’s also a bowl full of condoms, but it’s in the front office so if you take one about a dozen staff and visiting parents know.</strong></p><p>(2:31) <em>This isn’t making me fear any less for your partners.</em></p><p>(2:31) <em>No health classes at all??</em></p><p>(2:32) <strong>Wow, you really are concerned, huh?</strong></p><p>(2:32) <em>I feel it’s only fair that if I had to have the sex talk with my mother (extensively) then you can get a freaking health lesson.</em></p><p>(2:24) <strong>Were there diagrams?</strong></p><p>(2:24) <em>Yes.</em></p><p>(2:24) <em>We even had a special guest appearance by a doctor. He brought dummies.</em></p><p>(2:25) <strong>DUMMIES?? I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THOSE AT HOME.</strong></p><p>(2:25) <em>OH MY GOD NO MY DOCTOR DID NOT BRING A BLOW UP DOLL THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT</em></p><p>(2:26) <strong>TOO LATE I AM ENVISIONING IT</strong></p><p>(2:26) <em>CHRIST I MEANT LIKE PHYSICAL MODELS OF GENETALIA.

OH GOD.</em></p><p>(2:27) <strong>YOU HAVE DUG A HOLE MOONY</strong></p><p>(2:27) <em>GETTING BACK TO MY EARLIER POINT will I be bombarded with messages</em></p><p>(2:28) <strong>Of course not, Moony.

  <u>Saturday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(12:08) <em>You lied to me.</em></p><p>(12:09) <strong>Technically, it wasn’t Friday anymore, so I upheld my end of the deal.</strong></p><p>(12:10) <em>Still woke me up at an ungodly hour.</em></p><p>(12:11) <strong>Sorry. How can I make it up to you?</strong></p><p>(12:12) <em>I want to sleep now. I demand a bedtime story.</em></p><p>(12:12) <em>This should be interesting…</em></p><p>(12:13) <strong>Ok, ok.</strong></p><p>(12:14) <strong>There once was the most handsome boy in the universe… with the most glorious hair…</strong></p><p>(12:14) <em>Is this character’s name Padfoot, by any chance?</em></p><p>(12:14) <strong>NO INTERRUPTING</strong></p><p>(12:15) <strong>But yes. His name so happens to be Padfoot.</strong></p><p>(12:15) <em>I’m psychic.</em></p><p>(12:16) <strong>Is that what they call your illness?</strong></p><p>(12:16) <em>Ha-ha.</em></p><p>(12:16) <em>Keep going.</em></p><p>(12:17) <strong>Yes, thank you.</strong></p><p>(12:18) <strong>The most handsome boy with glorious hair, found to be named Padfoot, stumbled upon a lonely, gruesome castle.</strong></p><p>(12:20) <strong>As he approached the drawbridge, he was intercepted by a fearsome, ugly creature.</strong></p><p>(12:21)<strong> Let’s call it Prongs.</strong></p><p>(12:22) <strong>Prongs had the most grotesque growths erupting from his temples like antlers, that snagged on the arch of the drawbridge, making deep depressions in the brick.</strong></p><p>(12:23) <em>You’re actually quite good at this.</em></p><p>(12:23)<strong> I know. Now shut up.</strong></p><p>(12:25) <strong>The most God-like Padfoot, who also happened to be a knight, approached the beast with confidence.</strong></p><p>(12:26) <strong>”Creature,” he called out to it, “What business have you here?”</strong></p><p>(12:27) <strong>”I could ask the same of you, fuckwit,” the delinquent creature replied.</strong></p><p>(12:28) <strong>But Padfoot was unperturbed. “I am here to rescue the fair prince from your evil clutches!”</strong></p><p>(12:29) <em>Please tell me I’m not the prince.</em></p><p>(12:30) <strong>You’re not the prince.</strong></p><p>(12:30) <em>Oh thank god.</em></p><p>(12:32) <strong>”You must kill me first!” Prongs roared, and charged at the knight with antlers in front, hoping to impale his victim.</strong></p><p>(12:33) <strong>But Padfoot was too quick, and ducked to the side of Prongs, and slipped his golden, diamond encrusted blade into its ribcage and piercing its heart.</strong></p><p>(12:34)<strong> It died.</strong></p><p>(12:35) <em>That’s anti-climatic.</em></p><p>(12:36) <strong>ITS DYING SCREAMS COULD BE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, TURNING ALL THE CITIZENS’ BLOOD COLD. THE BEAST KEELED OVER, CLUTCHING AT ITS BLEEDING CHEST, AND HOWELED FOR THE MERCY OF THE LORD AND FOR ITS MOTHER. “OH BRAVE KNIGHT,” HE GASPED, “ONLY YOU WERE WORTHY OF KILLING ME. YOU MAY PROCEED TO THE PRINCE.”</strong></p><p>(12:37) <em>Smart arse.</em></p><p>(12:38) <strong>The brave Padfoot passed the corpse of the beast, proceeding on the drawbridge and entering the castle courtyard. There he found the prince.</strong></p><p>(12:39) <em>Just hanging out in the courtyard?</em></p><p>(12:39) <strong>Moony I still have a hangover, this is the best I can do.</strong></p><p>(12:40) <em>Fine, fine. Continue.</em></p><p>(12:41) <strong>The prince gazed upon the knight, in awe of his heroic deeds, and opened his arms to welcome him. "Bravest man I know,” he smiled, “Padfoot, come to me. I must thank you for saving me from the beast. Come, closer, so I may look upon your handsome face.</strong></p><p>(12:42) <strong>Padfoot, slightly creeped out, approached the prince, asking him, “And what is your name, Your Highness?”</strong></p><p>(12:45) <strong>”My name is Wormtail. Closer, son, so I may touch your hair.”</strong></p><p>(12:46) <strong>By this point, Padfoot was thoroughly weirded out, and stopped in his tracks. “Nah, don’t think I will,” he said to Wormtail, “I’ve changed my mind. Cya later.”</strong></p><p>(12:47) <strong>But Wormtail was not happy with that. “NO YOU NEED TO COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW,” he shouted, but when Padfoot turned, Wormtail had transformed into a giant, grey rat, his teeth sharpened like needles and eyes yellow and beady. Upon reflection, Padfoot didn’t think he looked all that different from when he was human.</strong></p><p>(12:48) <em>That’s cruel.</em></p><p>(12:49) <strong>Shhhh</strong></p><p>(12:50) <strong>Wormtail the rat had started at Padfoot, launching at him quickly, and got Padfoot in his evil clutches. He tried to bite at his neck, but then thick red blood came pouring from his mouth instead, drenching Padfoot in the process. It was hella gross.</strong></p><p>(12:52) <strong>Once Padfoot had managed to get the fat, lumping beast off his body, before him was revealed to be his dashing hero, clad in silver shimmering armour. He was pale and scrawny with green eyes, but super fuckin hot.</strong></p><p>(12:53) <em>Jesus Christ</em></p><p>(12:54) <strong>Sweat was glistening from his smooth brow, and extended one arm to Padfoot as he said, “Come friend, you are safe now. We must run off into the sunset and live happily ever after.”</strong></p><p>(12:55) <strong>So Padfoot took Moony’s hand, and they both ran off into the sunset and lived happily ever after. The end.</strong></p><p>(12:56) <strong>Was that any good?</strong></p><p>(12:57) <em>It was entertaining, for sure.</em></p><p>(12:58) <strong>Sleepy yet?</strong></p><p>(12:59) <em>Oh yeah. But there is a screaming child in here. This is what the rapture sounds like.</em></p><p>(1:00) <strong>Just remember that you were once a screaming child too.</strong></p><p>(1:02) <em>You still are a screaming child.</em></p><p>(1:02) <em>I’m going to try to nap, regardless.</em></p><p>(1:03) <em>Thank you for the tale, Padfoot. You have a real flare in story telling.</em></p><p>(1:04) <strong>Thank you, Moony.</strong></p><p>(1:05) <strong>(Don’t tell the punk rock brigade)</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

  <u>Monday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:12) <strong>It’s a Monday morning and my head is killing me.</strong></p><p>(9:13) <em>Your mistake, Shot Leg.</em></p><p>(9:13) <strong>I knoooooooow, I knoooooow don’t rub it in.</strong></p><p>(9:14) <strong>In other news: Prongs is dating ‘the one’.</strong></p><p>(9:14) <em>How does that make you feel?</em></p><p>(9:15) <strong>Wow, do people actually say that?</strong></p><p>(9:15) <em>My psychologist does and I have to refrain from laughing every time.</em></p><p>(9:16) <strong>…you see a psychologist?</strong></p><p>(9:16) <em>Most teens with a chronic illness do. No big deal.</em></p><p>(9:16) <strong>Ok then.</strong></p><p>(9:17) <strong>Well yes, I am super stoked for him. I don’t think he’s stopped smiling for twelve solid hours. It looks painful.</strong></p><p>(9:17) <strong>Only downside is that he still won’t shut up about her, and this time he has solid fact to back up his stupid, whimsical purple prose about her hair. Or something.</strong></p><p>(9:18) <em>That’s adorable.</em></p><p>(9:19) <strong>Don’t</strong></p><p>(9:19) <em>All right, all right. Do you feel replaced, by any chance?</em></p><p>(9:20) <strong>Absolutely not. Moony, I can assure you there are no legitimate hard feelings toward the situation and I look forward to the day I get to be best man at their wedding. Mostly bc I’ll get to make an embarrassing speech.</strong></p><p>(9:21) <em>”Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union between these two people, and that one time Prongs did something really embarrassing that I will now tell you all about.”</em></p><p>(9:22) <strong>”I remember the first time Prongs told me about kissing his now wife, and how he described it as like kissing fireworks. What a pretentious wanker.”</strong></p><p>(9:23) <em>Did he really?</em></p><p>(9:23) <strong>Oh yeah. I used up all my good manners for the year to not laugh.</strong></p><p>(9:24) <em>Do you not believe him?</em></p><p>(9:24) <strong>Maybe. I guess it’s the ‘the one’ thing.</strong></p><p>(9:25) <em>Have you kissed anyone before?</em></p><p>(9:26) <strong>A few girls here and there. It was nice, but it wasn’t fireworks.</strong></p><p>(9:27) <strong>Have you kissed anyone?</strong></p><p>(9:27) <em>Yeah.</em></p><p>(9:28) <strong>How was it?</strong></p><p>(9:29) <em>It was good at the time, but thinking about it now makes me feel a little sick.</em></p><p>(9:30) <em>They’re with someone else now.</em></p><p>(9:30) <strong>Oh, shit. Sorry Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:31) <em>Oh, it’s ok. It’s not that I even particularly fancied them or anything but the circumstances were…</em></p><p>(9:32) <em>Well, they kind of used me.</em></p><p>(9:32) <em>That’s probably more than you wanted to know.</em></p><p>(9:33) <strong>Do you still see them?</strong></p><p>(9:34) <em>Hah, yeah, they’re here right now. In this wing.</em></p><p>(9:34) <em>I’m friends with them still, and I’m quite close with the person they’re seeing so I’m fine with it, really. Just remembering it, though, isn’t good.</em></p><p>(9:35) <em>Honestly, this isn’t a tragedy story. I’ve probably made it sound worse than it is.</em></p><p>(9:36) <strong>What was their name?</strong></p><p>(9:39) <em>Uh… Frank.</em></p><p>(9:40) <strong>You kissed a bloke</strong></p><p>(9:40) <strong>That has an old man’s name?</strong></p><p>(9:41) <em>His surname is even funnier, but I don’t think I should tell you that.</em></p><p>(9:41) <strong>Damn, I feel like I’ve missed out.</strong></p><p>(9:42) <em>Oh you have.</em></p><p>(9:43) <strong>All the stalking opportunities… and beating up opportunities…</strong></p><p>(9:43) <em>Padfoot</em></p><p>(9:44) <strong>Hey, just saying. The offer is there.</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>I think I’ll take that as a token of good friendship.</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>Oh, you bet. No one messes around with Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>In that case, come beat up my nurse for me. He won’t let me outside.</em></p><p>(9:47) <strong>Climb out the window.</strong></p><p>(9:48) <em>Wow Padfoot you are a genius.</em></p><p>(9:49) <strong>Fine. Next time he tries to, idk, inject you with something, take the needle from his hand and jab it into his neck. And flee to freedom.</strong></p><p>(9:50) <em>Maybe I should really reconsider that I’m texting a murderer.</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>Probably. I’m about to kill Prongs. They’re holding hands /in class/.</strong></p><p>(9:51) <em>Find a needle. Jab it into your own neck.</em></p><p>(9:52) <strong>Will a pen do?</strong></p><p>(9:53) <em>Only if you jab it hard enough.</em></p><p>(9:55) <strong>I threw a paper ball at them and now I think Prongs will kill me himself.</strong></p><p>(9:56) <em>I’ll testify at the trial. You did not deserve to die in so cruel a fashion.</em></p><p>(10:00) <strong>What’s happening on your end?</strong></p><p>(10:01) <em>Uh… nothing really… mostly everyone’s still asleep…</em></p><p>(10:02) <em>Oh my parents are here.

I’m just making fun of you.</strong></p><p>(10:00) <strong>Really, you are an inspiration to us all.</strong></p><p>(10:01) How so?</p><p>(10:02) <strong>If you whine and pine long enough something might come of it.</strong></p><p>(10:03) Oh, shut up. You know, you’re getting a bit that way yourself.</p><p>(10:04) <strong>What?</strong></p><p>(10:05) Whining and pining</p><p>(10:05) <strong>About what?</strong></p><p>(10:06) More about ‘who’</p><p>(10:06) <strong>”””””””””Who””””””””???</strong></p><p>(10:06) That stranger you message.</p><p>(10:07) <strong>Moony?</strong></p><p>(10:07) OH MY GOD YOU GAVE HIM A NICKNAME</p><p>(10:08) <strong>WELL I HAD TO CALL HIM SOMETHING</strong></p><p>(10:08) WHAT HAPPENED TO PUMPKIN TIT???</p><p>(10:09) <strong>IT WAS BC OF YOU I CHANGED IT</strong></p><p>(10:09) Wow.

</p><p>(8:34) <em>I never asked – how’s your ankle?</em></p><p>(8:35) <strong>Oh, Moony, you do care!</strong></p><p>(8:35) <strong>It’s fine. I have crutches and I get to hit people with them. Especially Wormtail, the ungrateful git.</strong></p><p>(8:36) <em>He’s not fawning over you for your heroic deeds?</em></p><p>(8:36) <strong>No! He’s not! He should be the one feeding me grapes.</strong></p><p>(8:37) <em>Your own man servant. I have one of those too. I press a button and they come running. All I want is the window open.</em></p><p>(8:38) <strong>That’s cruel abuse of power, Moony. I love it.</strong></p><p>(8:38) <strong>How were your parents?</strong></p><p>(8:39) <em>Oh, good, good.

</p><p>(11:12) <em>Do you ever find that you have more stuff when your packing to go home?</em></p><p>(11:12) <em>Even though half of your socks are missing?</em></p><p>(11:13) <strong>Oh yeah. I also gain, like, three extra ties too.</strong></p><p>(11:14) <em>Wait, you have to wear a tie as uniform?</em></p><p>(11:14) <strong>Yes. Boarding school, Moony, it’s fancy stuff.</strong></p><p>(11:15) <em>Apparently. Wow. Do you have school houses too?</em></p><p>(11:15) <strong>…Go Lions.</strong></p><p>(11:15) <em>You’re kidding. You compete against your own school? In your houses?</em></p><p>(11:16) <strong>Yeah, and them whoever wins out of us gets to go against other schools. Lions are on top.</strong></p><p>(11:16) <em>Boarding schools are incredible.</em></p><p>(11:17) <strong>Do you have to wear hospital gowns all the time??</strong></p><p>(11:17) <em>No, because we don’t conform to stereotypes. They’re only for surgery etc.</em></p><p>(11:18) <em>We do wear the bracelets, however.</em></p><p>(11:19) <strong>What, like the plastic ones they put on babies?</strong></p><p>(11:19) <em>Yes, Padfoot, like they put on babies. Because they are in a hospital.</em></p><p>(11:21) <strong>So how’s your packing going?</strong></p><p>(11:21) <em>Terrible. You won’t shut up.</em></p><p>(11:22) <strong>You started it.</strong></p><p>(11:22) <em>I DON’T EVEN OWN PINK SOCKS WHOSE ARE THESE</em></p><p>(11:23) <strong>HAHA I ONCE ENDED UP WITH WORMTAIL’S BOXERS.

I don’t know if I should give them back or</em></p><p>(11:25) <strong>I threw Wormy’s boxers at his head. Try that.</strong></p><p>(11:26) <em>She’s sleeping, she’ll probably kill me.

There’s only so much mischief three sick teenagers can get up to without dying.</em></p><p>(11:34) <em>We definitely can’t flood a hospital.</em></p><p>(11:35) <strong>You could try though, and get thrown into jail for it. It’s also really unethical and all.</strong></p><p>(11:36) <em>Exactly.</em></p><p>(11:37) <em>Oh she’s awake, and has looked in her bag.</em></p><p>(11:38) <em>HAH – “where the hell have these been I’ve been looking for them everywhere!”</em></p><p>(11:39) <strong>Say nothing, do nothing.</strong></p><p>(11:40) <em>Me – “Oh, that’s strange.”</em></p><p>(11:40) <em>Alice – “YOU DID THIS DIDN’T YOU”</em></p><p>(11:41) <em>She even used my full name.</em></p><p>(11:41) <em>”WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING SO HARD.

</p><p>(7:08) <strong>How did the attack go?</strong></p><p>(7:09) <em>She tickled me and I made this horrible squealing sound that she won’t let me live down.</em></p><p>(7:09) <strong>Wow I wish I was there to hear that.</strong></p><p>(7:10) <em>I sounded like a pig in slaughter.</em></p><p>(7:10) <strong>Last night in the hospital, huh?</strong></p><p>(7:11) <em>Yeah. For now, at least. Alice has thrown a farewell party.</em></p><p>(7:11) <em>As much a party as a hospital can provide.

Don’t tell.</em></p><p>(7:13) <strong>Your secret is safe with me, Moony.</strong></p><p>(7:14) <em>She seems to think you’re a middle aged man preying on me, however.</em></p><p>(7:15) <strong>Ooo so you’ve told her about me, huh?</strong></p><p>(7:16) <em>It was either continued to be tickled or tell. At one point she threatened to go through the messages, which is not happening on my watch.</em></p><p>(7:16) <strong>Does she know about the Frank thing?</strong></p><p>(7:17) <em>She does not.</em></p><p>(7:17) <strong>I see.</strong></p><p>(7:18) <em>Do your friends know about me?</em></p><p>(7:18) <strong>Oh yeah. Wormtail thinks it’s a little weird. Prongs thinks it’s hilarious.</strong></p><p>(7:19) <em>And what do you think? About the whole situation?</em></p><p>(7:20) <strong>I think it doesn’t matter how it happened. Just that I’m glad it did.</strong></p><p>(7:20) <strong>I think you underestimate how much I like talking to you, Moony.</strong></p><p>(7:21) <em>I guess I just don’t really understand… why.</em></p><p>(7:21) <em>Wait, you don’t have to answer that.</em></p><p>(7:22) <strong>I like talking to you bc you’re funny in a twisted kind of way. And you’re insightful and helpful and idk, you’re just cool.</strong></p><p>(7:23) <strong>You’re a good person, Moony.

I don’t know what to say that isn’t completely stupid.</em></p><p>(7:26) <strong>Just take the compliment.</strong></p><p>(7:27) <em>Thank you, Padfoot. I must go now, I’m being surprised.

</p><p>(9:44) <strong>Hungover?</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>Do you honestly think I would be allowed to drink in a hospital to the point of intoxication?</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>No, but I’d like to hear that you tried.</strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>The first and last time I tried to get drunk the Frank thing happened and my mother grounded me.

This was meant to be Me, Not Making it a Big Deal.</em></p><p>(12:04) <strong>I think it is a Big Deal, but you keep downplaying it bc you think it’s not a big deal by other’s standards.</strong></p><p>(12:04) <strong>So, you still don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to for any reason.</strong></p><p>(12:05) <em>But it’s holding me back from doing… things. And it was suggested that I, in crude terms, ‘get over it,’ so I can get on with doing things. I guess the first step of getting over it is to tell someone about it. And hey, you asked, so here you go.</em></p><p>(12:06) <strong>Don’t take this the wrong way, /please/, but didn’t you say you had a psychologist?</strong></p><p>(12:07) <em>Hospital psychologist. Sees everyone in the ward. Group therapy. Would want to talk to Frank about it. No thank you.</em></p><p>(12:07) <strong>Ok then. Tell me about the Frank thing, which we have now come to call it.</strong></p><p>(12:08) <em>I guess like most cliché stories, it started with liquor and truth or dare.</em></p><p>(12:09) <strong>We’ve all been there, mate.</strong></p><p>(12:10) <em>We were on my hospital bed, and this was the first time either of us had drunk alcohol, so naturally it took like two minutes for it to take effect. Frank’s brilliant idea to play truth or dare, and I’d never played that either before, so I said ok.</em></p><p>(12:11) <em>I didn’t really know what kind of questions to ask, so I just re-asked whatever he asked me. We’d both never been kissed before, it turned out.</em></p><p>(12:12) <em>One of the truths, he asked me if I was gay. I said yes. He picked truth, I asked him if he was gay, and he said he didn’t know, maybe a little.</em></p><p>(12:13) <em>I then picked dare because I hadn’t yet, and he dared me to kiss him. And because I was drunk and gay I did.</em></p><p>(12:13) <strong>I’d like to interrupt this story for a repeat of the description ‘drunk and gay’.</strong></p><p>(12:14) <em>So, so drunk and so, so gay.</em></p><p>(12:14) <strong>Thank you. Continue.</strong></p><p>(12:15) <em>So, I kissed him. And like you said, it wasn’t fireworks, but it felt right. Like it was normal and natural. So I thought it went ok.</em></p><p>(12:16) <em>He picked truth again and so I asked him if he was gay. He said again, I don’t know, maybe a little. And not long after we went to bed.</em></p><p>(12:17) <em>The next day he asked Alice out and she yes.</em></p><p>(12:17) <strong>WOAH WAIT WHAT</strong></p><p>(12:18) <em>When I asked him about the kiss thing he said he was drunk and curious, he hoped there were no hard feelings. Turns out he’s not gay, not even a little bit.</em></p><p>(12:19) <strong>I’d hate to break this to you Moony, but even by regular people standards, this is a Big Deal.</strong></p><p>(12:19) <strong>It is also categorized as a Dick Move.</strong></p><p>(12:20) <em>Hah, you got that right.</em></p><p>(12:21) <em>So, there we. The Frank thing.</em></p><p>(12:22) <strong>And you’re still friends with this guy?</strong></p><p>(12:22) <em>I’m more friends with Alice. He comes in conjunction.</em></p><p>(12:23) <em>Admittedly, I think I’m more snappy at him than what I would usually be.</em></p><p>(12:23) <strong>I think he deserves more than ‘snappy’. Let’s go for, ‘waspish,’ ‘aggravated,’ slowly move our way toward ‘murderous.’</strong></p><p>(12:24) <em>The transition will be so smooth he won’t understand why there’s a pillow smothering his face.</em></p><p>(12:25) <strong>That’s what I like to hear!</strong></p><p>(12:25) <em>Just a cheeky bit of murder to finish the night.</em></p><p>(12:26) <strong>How are you feeling about it?</strong></p><p>(12:27) <em>A little better, I guess. Mortified, actually.</em></p><p>(12:27) <strong>Dude, you got screwed over by a dick. Not your fault. Personally, I’d like to meet Frank and, say, push him out a window.</strong></p><p>(12:28) <em>Calm down, Game of Thrones.</em></p><p>(12:28) <strong>I’d have a catchphrase while I do it, too. Like, idk, ‘FOR MOONY!’ and out the window.</strong></p><p>(12:29) <em>I think you need to work on your catchphrase a bit.</em></p><p>(12:30) <strong>Shush, it’s too late for thinking.</strong></p><p>(12:31) <em>Thank you, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(12:31) <strong>I didn’t really do anything, Moony.</strong></p><p>(12:32) <em>Just for… listening. Offering to assassinate him. Stuff like that.</em></p><p>(12:32) <strong>Pleasure is all mine, Moony. I’ve always wanted to kill a man.</strong></p><p>(12:33) <em>Oh my god, you are a murderer. This is a lure.</em></p><p>(12:34) <strong>HAH no, no. Go to sleep, Moony.</strong></p><p>(12:34) <em>Ok. You too, though.</em></p><p>(12:35) <strong>Yeah, yeah. Good night, Moony.</strong></p><p>(12:35) <em>Good night, Padfoot.</em></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Friday AM</u>
</p><p>(10:15) Ok, I wasn’t going to mention it, but you look murderous.</p><p>(10:16) <strong>Have you ever wanted to hurt someone you’ve never met?</strong></p><p>(10:16) I’m guessing Hitler doesn’t count.</p><p>(10:17) <strong>Not quite.</strong></p><p>(10:17) So, what did Moony do?</p><p>(10:18) <strong>Oh, god, nothing. It’s what someone did to Moony.</strong></p><p>(10:18) What did they do to Moony?</p><p>(10:19) <strong>Short story: they used him. He doesn’t feel good about it.</strong></p><p>(10:19) And this warrants a beating?</p><p>(10:20) <strong>Yes!!</strong></p><p>(10:20) Ok, ok, just making sure.</p><p>(10:21) <strong>It’s frustrating, Prongs. He’s god knows where and I’m here. I can’t beat up people from here.</strong></p><p>(10:21) Have you ever considered meeting the guy?</p><p>(10:22) <strong>Obviously.</strong></p><p>(10:23) And?</p><p>(10:23) <strong>He won’t even tell me his real name.</strong></p><p>(10:24) Then I guess you just have to be patient. Write a list of people to beat up for later.</p><p>(10:24) <strong>… Still frustrating.</strong></p><p>(10:25) Yeah, I know. So close yet so far.</p><p>(10:26) <strong>What made Lily change her mind?</strong></p><p>(10:26) She said I had matured. I guess she’s right.</p><p>(10:27) <strong>You guess? When was the last time we set off a fart bomb?</strong></p><p>(10:27) Do you want to set off a fart bomb?</p><p>(10:28) <strong>Yeah, but, we’ve established that I have to wait.</strong></p><p>(10:28) I guess that marks your level of evolved maturity.</p><p>(10:28) <strong>I’m very specific for when I’m suddenly not mature anymore.</strong></p><p>(10:29) That’s how you’ve always been though. Cheer up, Pads. At least Moony hasn’t hated for six years before talking to you.</p><p>(10:29) <strong>Ahh, yes. It always makes me feel better when we compare things to your failed love life. Like, damn Prongs. You’re sad.</strong></p><p>(10:30) Yes, yes, I suck and I know it. I shouldn’t have brought this up. You can stop smiling now.</p><p>(10:30) <strong>No.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(11:24) <em>My grandmother is here. Need immediate back up. Possibly a SWAT team.</em></p><p>(11:25) <strong>Too many biscuits?</strong></p><p>(11:25) <em>Yes. She also keeps asking me about girlfriends.</em></p><p>(11:26) <strong>Whoops.</strong></p><p>(11:26) <strong>Does your family know?</strong></p><p>(11:27) <em>My mum does. She’s useless, though. She’s just sitting in the corner of the lounge room giggling.</em></p><p>(11:27) <em>The grandmother that’s here is my dad’s mum.</em></p><p>(11:28) <em>Oh my god she’s moved onto University.</em></p><p>(11:29) <strong>HAHA. So what are your plans for the future?</strong></p><p>(11:29) <em>Not becoming a grandparent, for one.</em></p><p>(11:30) <strong>I think the gay thing nipped that in the bud.</strong></p><p>(11:30) <em>So did my infertility. There are such things as miracles. She at least won’t ask about kids now.</em></p><p>(11:31) <strong>I hope Prongs has kids so I can hang out with it, but don’t actually have to raise it.</strong></p><p>(11:32) <em>Strategic. I like it. Also means to get to have fun with and without a child.</em></p><p>(11:32) <strong>Exactly!</strong></p><p>(11:33) <em>Oh no, mum’s pulled out the photo album.</em></p><p>(11:33) <em>Why does this always happen.</em></p><p>(11:34) <strong>The world is cruel, Moony.</strong></p><p>(11:34) <em>Grandma: he looked weird as a boy.</em></p><p>(11:34) <em>Thanks Grandma. I’m right here.</em></p><p>(11:35) <strong>HAHA HOW CHARMING</strong></p><p>(11:35) <strong>Man, I love old people.</strong></p><p>(11:36) <em>Naked baby photos. Oh no.</em></p><p>(11:36) <strong>I’m missing out.</strong></p><p>(11:37) <em>Don’t perve on my baby pictures!</em></p><p>(11:37) <strong>Oh my god no. I’m all for humiliation. Not peadophilia.</strong></p><p>(11:38) <em>Thank god for that. You sound more and more like a criminal every day.</em></p><p>(11:39) <strong>Do you like the danger, Moony?</strong></p><p>(11:40) <em>The potential danger of being killed by a stranger I text everyday? No, can’t say I do.</em></p><p>(11:40) <strong>Would it change your mind if I told you I have a motorbike?</strong></p><p>(11:41) <em>…Do you seriously?</em></p><p>(11:41) <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>(11:42) <em>Oh my god.</em></p><p>(11:42) <strong>What?</strong></p><p>(11:43) <em>That’s really cool.</em></p><p>(11:43) <strong>Aw, Moony, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.</strong></p><p>(11:44) <em>Can you ride it?</em></p><p>(11:44) <strong>Technically? Yes. Legally? Not quite.</strong></p><p>(11:45) <strong>Yeah, breathe in that danger.</strong></p><p>(11:46) <em>Mmmm, smells like dead pedestrians.</em></p><p>(11:46) <strong>I’ll have you know that only myself and Prongs have been injured since the creation of the bike.</strong></p><p>(11:47) <em>Creation?</em></p><p>(11:47) <strong>Yeah, I built it from scratch.</strong></p><p>(11:48) <em>That’s amazing. That’s… incredible.</em></p><p>(11:49) <strong>Aw, shucks.</strong></p><p>(11:49) <em>Does it have a name?</em></p><p>(11:50) <strong>Is that something you do?</strong></p><p>(11:50) <em>Well, you made it. It’s like a child in itself.</em></p><p>(11:51) <strong>I’ll have to brainstorm, and then I’ll get back to you.</strong></p><p>(11:52) <em>Please, do. If it’s anything like your stripper name, it’ll be interesting to say the least.</em></p><p>(11:55) <em>Padfoot?</em></p><p>(11:58) <strong>We’re gonna have topostopone that brainstoms Moony. I just ran intoa pole andi thinki have a concucssion goodbye</strong></p><p>(11:59) <em>Oh my god Padfoot.</em></p><p>(12:00) <em>I’m sorry, I’m laughing but I can’t stop.</em></p><p>(12:01) <em>Jesus, Pads.</em></p><p>(12:02) <strong>Dikc</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

How boring.</strong></p><p>(9:03) <em>What happened to you?</em></p><p>(9:04) <strong>I, um, ran into a pole.</strong></p><p>(9:04) <em>I’m sorry, what? Can you repeat that in simpler terms?</em></p><p>(9:05) <strong>HEAD GO BANG ON POLE.</strong></p><p>(9:05) <em>WHY HOW DID THIS HAPPEN</em></p><p>(9:06) <strong>BC I WAS TOO BUSY TEXTING YOU, YOU GIT. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. MY HEAD HURTS AND IT’S PURPLE.</strong></p><p>(9:07) <em>So, did you sleep the whole day?</em></p><p>(9:07) <strong>Yes. I also get to spend today in bed bc why not, my ankle is sprained too.</strong></p><p>(9:08) <em>Poor baby Padfoot.</em></p><p>(9:08) <strong>Everyone needs to stop patronizing me.</strong></p><p>(9:09) <em>I’m sorry.

That’s why I’m taking today off.</strong></p><p>(9:12) <em>…It’s Saturday.</em></p><p>(9:12) <strong>There’s still things that need to be done on a Saturday.</strong></p><p>(9:13) <strong>Like tending to Elvendork.</strong></p><p>(9:13) <em>Is that meant to be the bike?</em></p><p>(9:14) <strong>Yes!</strong></p><p>(9:14) <em>What kind of name is that!</em></p><p>(9:15) <strong>A unisex one!</strong></p><p>(9:15) <em>I expected something like… Midnight Beast, Raven’s Plume, something dark and sinister.</em></p><p>(9:16) <strong>Raven’s Plume?</strong></p><p>(9:16) <em>I still think it’s better than yours.</em></p><p>(9:17) <strong>Too bad, Moony.

</p><p>(11:43) <strong>Saturday was a long day.</strong></p><p>(11:43) <em>Oh, you’re back.</em></p><p>(11:44) <strong>Let’s just forget the whole thing happened, yes?</strong></p><p>(11:45) <em>Do you mean when Prongs took your phone, or when he told me you peed yourself when you were eleven?</em></p><p>(11:45) <strong>I’m going to say both. Forget both. Delete it now.</strong></p><p>(11:46) <em>But whatever will I blackmail you with now?</em></p><p>(11:47) <strong>I was hoping we could avoid blackmail.</strong></p><p>(11:47) <em>Nonsense. Strong friendships are built on blackmail.</em></p><p>(11:48) <strong>I don’t know what kind of friends you have over them, but ditch them now.</strong></p><p>(11:48) <em>I don’t have many, admittedly. Alice, Frank.</em></p><p>(11:48) <em>Uh, you.</em></p><p>(11:49) <strong>Thinking about it, I have Prongs, Wormtail, I guess Lily now…</strong></p><p>(11:49) <strong>And you.</strong></p><p>(11:50) <em>You still one up me.</em></p><p>(11:50) <strong>I can’t help that I’m so popular.</strong></p><p>(11:51) <strong>Soo… is this what we’re calling it?

But having said that, I am the third in my family.</strong></p><p>(12:33) <em>Sirius the Third.

I’m not even the Third or anything.</em></p><p>(12:36) <strong>Ah, so less common than Sirius then?</strong></p><p>(12:37) <em>I refuse to believe that.</em></p><p>(12:37) <strong>So, was it ok then?</strong></p><p>(12:38) <em>The phone call?

</p><p>(9:55) <strong>Describe your ideal date.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>…What?</em></p><p>(9:55) <em>Ok, do you mean the person or the going out?</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>The going out.

I had the ‘Psycho’ music playing the back of my mind every time I stabbed at my (pink) cake.</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>So, I guess that’s not an ideal date. But it was still a date?</em></p><p>(10:03) <strong>If we HAVE to call it that.</strong></p><p>(10:04) <em>I know Alice and Frank go to this one diner they like.

</p><p>(7:34) <em>I have been left to care for children.</em></p><p>(7:34) <em>I can hardly look after myself.</em></p><p>(7:35) <strong>How many children?</strong></p><p>(7:35) <em>Two. Boys. Ginger.</em></p><p>(7:36) <strong>Why is ginger important?</strong></p><p>(7:36) <em>They are just so, so ginger.</em></p><p>(7:37) <em>They even have the freckles.</em>THEY ARE BREAKING THINGS</p><p>(7:38) <strong>Haha, wow, have you ever baby sat before?</strong></p><p>(7:38) <em>No. People usually baby sit me.</em></p><p>(7:39) <strong>Then you should know what kind of things are involved!</strong></p><p>(7:40) <em>Yes, but I was always a compliant child. These… things just don’t listen.</em></p><p>(7:41) <strong>What are they doing now?</strong></p><p>(7:43) <em>Using ceramic plates as a stacking tower.</em></p><p>(7:44) <strong>Are you… going to stop them from doing that?</strong></p><p>(7:45) <em>I’m actually too impressed to stop them. They have a good balance going.</em></p><p>(7:46) <strong>Moony, you’re useless!</strong></p><p>(7:47) <em>Or at least a terrible authority figure. They need to bathe now hang on.</em></p><p>(8:00) <em>They are finally in.</em></p><p>(8:01) <strong>Whose kids are these? You didn't just take some, right?</strong></p><p>(8:02) <em>Of course not. Distant relative and a friend of a friend. I’m not actually quite sure. All I know is that their mother (and mine) are thirty minutes late from picking me up.</em></p><p>(8:03) <strong>Are you at their house?</strong></p><p>(8:03) <em>Yeah. It’s actually very cozy in here – uh oh they’re having a water fight.</em></p><p>(8:04) <strong>Please tell me you joined in.</strong></p><p>(8:12) <em>I joined in. I am soaked. The bathroom is flooded. The boys have collapsed on the couch in towels. They are now watching Spongebob.</em></p><p>(8:12) <em>Bath time did not last as long as I wanted it to.</em></p><p>(8:13) <strong>What episode of Spongebob is it?</strong></p><p>(8:13) <em>…Krusty Krab Pizza.</em></p><p>(8:14) <strong>Mmm. Good episode.</strong></p><p>(8:14) <em>Why does this not surprise me.</em></p><p>(8:15) <strong>Bc I am actually still a child?</strong></p><p>(8:15) <em>That seems most logical.</em></p><p>(8:16) <em>Oh my god kids are hilarious</em></p><p>(8:17) <em>”Bill, you look a bit like a pizza.”</em></p><p>(8:17) <em>”Shut up, Charlie, you’re as dumb as Patrick Star.”</em></p><p>(8:18) <strong>LAYIN’ DOWN SOME SICK BURNS</strong></p><p>(8:19) <em>HAHA APPARENTLY.

The idea of pregnancy terrifies her. I think Frank's slightly relieved by that.</em></p><p>(8:21) <strong>Pregnancy looks terrible. Women deserve the world after all the shit they go through.<br/></strong></p><p>(8:22) <strong>I remember you mentioning you couldn’t have kids.</strong></p><p>(8:23) <em>Add it to your list of symptoms.</em></p><p>(8:23) <strong>Sorry, that was intrusive.</strong></p><p>(8:24) <em>Oh, no, it’s fine.</em></p><p>(8:24) <em>Are you actually trying to figure out what it is, though? I don’t mind if you are.</em></p><p>(8:25) <strong>It crosses my mind.</strong></p><p>(8:25) <strong>No, I lied, I have a page full of theories and symptoms.</strong></p><p>(8:26) <em>Wow</em></p><p>(8:26) <strong>Sorry.

I’m actually quite eager to see if you can figure it out.</em></p><p>(8:30) <strong>Ok but you have to tell me now if it’s like super obscure and only you, Alice, and Frank have it.</strong></p><p>(8:31) <em>It’s not obscure. Quite well known. Frank and Alice don't have it, by the way.</em></p><p>(8:32) <strong>Oh,</strong> <strong>ok.</strong></p><p>(8:32) <em>And you have to figure it out.

  <u>Friday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:31) <strong>Who Am I?</strong></p><p>(9:31) <u>A dickhead</u></p><p>(9:31) Padfoot.</p><p>(9:32) <strong>Oh har har, you two are so hilarious. Come on, just play the game.</strong></p><p>(9:32) Fine. But if it’s like last time and the answer is ‘James’ and the clues are ‘smells like glue’ we’re going to have to ban you.</p><p>(9:33) <u>Answer: Peter. Clues: Looks like a horse. These things hurt, Padfoot.</u></p><p>(9:33) Wait, hang on, I’m have a premonition.</p><p>(9:33) Is the answer Moony.</p><p>(9:34) <strong>That’s a grammatically incorrect sentence, Prongs, you should be ashamed.</strong></p><p>(9:34) It’s not really a question. The answer is Moony. I already know.</p><p>(9:35) <u>Look, I’m sure he’s a great guy and everything, but damn can we talk about something else.</u></p><p>(9:35) <strong>A proposition has been made: if I can figure out what illness Moony has then we will meet.</strong></p><p>(9:36) …Wouldn’t this be cheating?</p><p>(9:36) <strong>He doesn’t have to know.</strong></p><p>(9:37) <u>So is this forreal? You gonna meet him?</u></p><p>(9:37) <strong>The plan is to figure it out as soon as possible and then gage when I want to meet him.

This class is boring anyway.</u></p><p>(9:38) Ok, go.</p><p>(9:39) <strong>Who Am I?</strong></p><p>(9:39) <strong>My physical features are pale and thin. I have moments of health that can suddenly decline to the point of hospitalization. I can’t play sports.</strong></p><p>(9:40) <strong>I have headaches. I puke (I think) and am infertile.</strong></p><p>(9:41) <u>Infertile? The fuck kinda stuff do you guys talk about?</u></p><p>(9:41) <strong>Obviously, I am now greatly reassured he won’t accidentally knock me up.</strong></p><p>(9:42) I’m glad. I don’t think I can handle two babies.</p><p>(9:42) <strong>Be quiet Prongs.</strong></p><p>(9:43) <strong>Bottom line: whatever it is I have, it is chronic.</strong></p><p>(9:43) <strong>And not something we haven’t heard about. It’s apparently ‘well known’.</strong></p><p>(9:44) <u>Why don’t you look up popular charities and list off those illnesses?</u></p><p>(9:45) <strong>He says I can’t just guess. I have to figure it out.</strong></p><p>(9:45) What are your theories so far?</p><p>(9:46) <strong>NOTHING. I HAVE NOTHING.</strong></p><p>(9:46) <u>You need to gather more data.</u></p><p>(9:47) <strong>Thanks Professor Wormtail.</strong></p><p>(9:47) <u>That’s Professor Pettigrew to you, Black.</u></p><p>(9:48) <strong>That’s Mr Black to you, Professor Pettigrew.</strong></p><p>(9:49) What are the rules on interrogation?</p><p>(9:49) <strong>I’m going to assume I can’t just out rightly ask for more symptoms. They have to be revealed.</strong></p><p>(9:50) <u>What is he, a fucking pass the parcel? Unwraps a layer each round?</u></p><p>(9:50) <strong>Or he’s a real person who is slowly trusting me. But idk. Take your pick.</strong></p><p>(9:50) Ok you two. Padfoot, we’re going to need more information.</p><p>(9:51) <strong>Ok. I think I can manage that.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

And while it’s lovely, it also means she’s not talking. I am bored. This is a long train ride.</p><p>(1:35) <strong>So you suck at art, huh?</strong></p><p>(1:35) She kept talking about all these artists and their life story and what each picture represented and all I could do was nod. I had no fuckin clue, man.</p><p>(1:36) <strong>At least she liked it?</strong></p><p>(1:36) Oh yeah, she thought it was fantastic. I still looked like a fool, though.</p><p>(1:37) <strong>It is the thought that counts.</strong></p><p>(1:37) Yeah, I guess.

Moony informed me that there are many spectrums and many different… things to consider. So not even a bi thing.

</p><p>(3:43) <em>I’m bored.</em></p><p>(3:43) <em>Remember when you were bored and I provided a light hearted tale?</em></p><p>(3:43) <em>Yes, I require one of those.</em></p><p>(3:55) <em>It has just occurred to me that you’re probably playing a game. Damn you.</em></p><p>(4:03) <strong>Lucky for you, I’ve been benched.</strong></p><p>(4:03) <em>Did you trip someone again?</em></p><p>(4:04) <strong>…Yes.</strong></p><p>(4:05) <strong>We haven’t had a phone conversation this week.</strong></p><p>(4:06) <em>No, we haven’t. Are you suggesting that now?</em></p><p>(4:07) <strong>We’ve still got an hour of this game. I don’t like watching without playing.</strong></p><p>(4:07) <em>Ok.</em></p><p>
  <em> <strong>[Calling Padfoot]</strong> </em>
</p><p>“<strong>Hey, babe.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You did not just call me babe.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Hell yeah I did, trophy wife.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>This is going too far. Divert the conversation.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK UP-</strong>”</p><p>“<em>STOP SHOUTING!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>-I’M AT A FOOTBALL MATCH, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>How’s this?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I guess that will do.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I hope you have conversation starters. I would hate for this to get awkward.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Never fear, Moony. I plan on commentating the game to you.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Ok then, if you think you can make that interesting.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Of course I can. I know everyone that’s playing, so you also get to hear interesting backstories.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Oh, how I look forward to it.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I know you’re ecstatic.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Get on with it, then. The hour isn’t going any faster.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>You have terrible phone manners, Moony. Anyway, Prongs has the ball. You probably know enough about him to write a report.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I am yet to acquire his fingerprints, sad to say. I can’t frame him for murder just yet.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Oh, I’ve sent them in the mail. They should arrive soon.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>About time.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>He’s passed it off to Gideon, who’s a big lumbering guy and once threw me bodily down a flight of stairs-</strong>What the fuc-“</p><p>“<strong>Oh, it was fine, we had pillows on the staircase.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>The more I hear of your boarding school, the less fancy it sounds.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Oh, yeah. The only thing that makes it fancy, Moony, is the amount of money you pay to be in there. And sometimes the hot chocolates are good.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>God bless the hot chocolates, then.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Alright, Gid has passed it off to his brother, Fabian. Who is also large and muscular. He’s the handsome brother of the two, but don’t tell Gid I said that.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>In case he throws you down some stairs?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yes, for exactly that reason-OH FUCK FABIAN’S BEEN INTERCEPTED. BY MY BROTHER NO LESS. THIS IS SHAME.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You have a brother?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yeah, but let’s not go there on back story just yet. He looks like me, except I’m the handsome brother of the two. You can tell Gideon that one.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’ll take your word on that, lest Gideon decides to cause me injury just for my state of scrawniness.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Oh, nah, Gid’s a gentle giant. He’d cradle you like a kitten.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Still not encouraging.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Sorry. OK MALFOY HAS THE BALL AND IS GOING UP TO THE GOALS-SHIT OH NO.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>What?!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>WORMTAIL’S THE GOALIE. OH MAN THIS IS TENSE-AH FUCK HE GOT IT IN.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>So are you winning or losing?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>IT’S A DRAW, MOONY. OH MY GOD.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Are you-are you jumping up and down?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yes, yes I am. It’s exciting stuff, Moony, I’m surprised you’re not on the edge of your seat.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Boy, it’s tempting.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok, Prongs in his God-like majesty has the ball. He’s passed it over to Gid, who then kicks it over to Crouch-Oh my god Barty is just going for it. That guy’s a loose canon.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Barty?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>No need to sound so blunt, Moony.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>That’s a name you give to a small boy.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>He is almost like a child. More childish than me, would you believe. When he talks to you he rubs his hands, which can be creepy, but he also licks his lips a lot, which is creepier.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Barty doesn't sound like a winner.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Barty doesn’t have bounds, he just keeps going. He’s slicing through everyone. Prongs is pissed.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Is he a ball hog?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yeah, and we always know that by the time he gets to the goals he panics and kicks the ball to the opposition-oh he’s up there now, come on!!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>What’s their goalie like?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Rosier. Lovely name, but he tried to sell me meth once, which was just a bit beyond my punk loyalties.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I went to a state school for, oh, maybe a year? When I was fourteen. The people I met there were nothing like this. They were… nice.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Nice?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Well they didn’t try to sell me drugs, so I guess I’m already one up on your private education.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I feel like there’s a ‘but’ here.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>They managed to fit me into a locker.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Christ, Remus.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>It could be worse. I could be on meth.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Barty missed the goal, by the way.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I figured, I think I heard someone swearing.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>That was Prongs. He’s been carded. Fucking idiot.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You guys really takes sports for real, huh?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>You’ll be like us soon if you keep those walks going.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Fuck off.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>What?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You’re making fun. See - stop laughing!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I’m sorry, I’m sorry.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>No you’re not, you’re still laughing! Arsehole!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok, Ok, I’m stopping. Oh shit-fuck. Fabian and Mulciber are punching each other. Christ, guys.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Does this happen often?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>What, the violence?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Yeah, it seems pretty feral over there.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>It’s just this team. Our rivals. Been like this since the beginning, and if we lose this week, then they won’t shut up about it for the next year.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>What’s the team?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Slytherin. Snakes. Fucking slimey gits.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Snakes aren’t slimey, Padfoot.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Cold blooded gits, then.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>That sounds like a better insult.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Haha, yeah, oh god. Prongs is punching Malfoy now and- oh the whole team is in on this. We are goiNG TO BE DISQUALIFIED.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Is football even being played anymore? What’s happening?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Nope, the ball has been stranded. Everyone is just pairing up and punching. We’re out numbered – oh, because I’m on the phone.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>…If you are waiting for permission to punch people, I don’t think I can allow that.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Just a friendly bit of fighting! Come on!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>What the hell- no you stay on that bench. Now I’m turning into /your/ mother.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Oh, speaking of mumsie, she’s watching from somewhere. I hope she saw me trip Reg.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’m going to assume that’s your brother.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yeah. Ok, ref is breaking it up now. Hang on… HAH! They’re calling the game off. No one wins!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>At least you won’t get mocked?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Exactly, Moony! We should do this more often!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Sports people are nuts. You guys are crazy!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>We prefer to be called ‘free spirits,’ if you would please, Moony.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Psycho.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Aw, you mean that affectionately, right?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Yeah, sure. My sweet psycho.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>How adorable! I love it, Moony. How about – oh, ok, I have to go now.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Yes, I am hearing the words ‘shut up’ and … ‘boyfriend’?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>That’s Prongs, definitely ignore him. Like, yeah. Ignore him. Ok. I have to go now. Bye, Remus.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Congratulations on the, uh, win? Bye, Sirius.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Bye, babe.</strong>”</p><p>

I require a scary story.</strong></p><p>(11:04) <em>Are you huddled around a fireplace in the middle of the woods?</em></p><p>(11:05) <strong>No.</strong></p><p>(11:05) <em>Then it can’t be done.</em></p><p>(11:06) <strong>You owe me a story! I gave you a story. A nice lighthearted tale.</strong></p><p>(11:06) <strong>OO I have marshmallows if that makes it any better.</strong></p><p>(11:07) <em>Where the hell did you get marshmallows?</em></p><p>(11:07) <strong>From under the bed.</strong></p><p>(11:08) <em>That wasn’t quite what I was asking but I don’t think I want an answer anymore.</em></p><p>(11:08) <strong>Do you know what I want? A scary story.</strong></p><p>(11:09) <em>Ok, fine, but don’t expect it to be fantastic. I’ve never told nor really heard a scary story before.</em></p><p>(11:09) <strong>Really? Man, you’re missing out on some real anxiety over creaking floorboards in that case.</strong></p><p>(11:10) <em>Ok. Hang on, give me a second.</em></p><p>
  <em> <strong>[Calling Padfoot]</strong> </em>
</p><p>“<em>It’s more affective this way, I think.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Mm, I agree. I’m going to have to whisper because it turns out Wormtail and Prongs were listening in on our last late night conversation.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Fair enough. I’ll whisper to so you don’t fall into a normal speaking voice.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>And so you don’t wake up Sheba.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Of course. Obviously.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Now, Moony, provide me with a story.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I can’t think of a way to start this that isn’t cliché.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I’ll do it then: it was a dark and stormy night.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>It was a dark and stormy night when you came walking back to your dormitory after an exceptionally good night of… motorbiking.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Wait, you’re making me the protagonist?! Dude, you’re gonna kill me!!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I don’t want to write my own death! Plus, you wanted the scary story. You might as well get kinda scared from it.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Fine. I was coming back from an exceptionally good night of motorbiking.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Everything was pitch black around you, and the night was silent bar the crunching leaves underfoot. You tried not to let the darkness get to you, but you couldn’t stop the shiver that ran down your spine as an owl hooted in the distance.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I sound like a baby.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’m pretty sure you had a rule of no interrupting.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Arrh, ok go.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Sneaking back into your dorm room was difficult, as the old building creaked under your steps. The wooden floor nearly shook with each passing step, and when you heard a creak three steps down, you hardly noticed.</em></p><p>“<em>The door groaned as you slowly opened it, and you found all your dorm mates were fast asleep. You throw your helmet onto your bed, and slump down on it to pull off your shoes when you notice the door still open, letting in streaks of moonlight.</em></p><p>“<em>You get up to close the door, an itching feeling tickling your back, and when you reach out blindly to find your bed your hand brushes a solid form. It feels like a jumper, and you jump back but immediately start punching into the darkness, but there’s nothing there. Clicking on your phone, you see nothing in the new light, and thus resign to go to bed.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Did I suddenly become a dickhead in this story?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’m just describing what would be real to life.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>You think I’d punch some air and let it be?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Ok, I lied. I think you’d squeal like a child and flail about a bit.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I would not!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Would so! Now shut up, you’re ruining the atmosphere.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Ok. Um. Oh, ok, so you’re lying in bed and trying to sleep off the exhaustion of an exceptionally good night of motorbiking when you notice the door is still open. You throw the covers off exasperatedly, and slam the door shut in your frustration.</em></p><p>
  <em>“But your dorm mates don’t stir.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You try to convince yourself it’s just a draft that’s shivering the back of your neck, and when you crawl into bed you try and ignore the sudden coldness of the bed. </em>
</p><p><em>“Is any of this doing anything?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>The floor board just creaked so yes. Keep going.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I feel like an idiot.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Keep going! I need to know how I die now. Come on.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Ok fine. The wind outside was howling, and through the crack in the windowsill it sounded like screams. While lying in the bed, you can’t help but feel an overpowering presence in the room. You can’t see a thing with your eyes open, but you imagine a stoic figure standing in the corner of the room, watching you watch him.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>It is pretty fuckin’ dark in here.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You’re not entirely sure, but you think you see the shadow in the darkness shift, and without thinking croak out, ‘Prongs?’ But he doesn’t respond.</em></p><p>
  <em>“You pull the blanket over your head, lighting up your phone in you makeshift tent, and through the blanket can see a dark spot moving over you.</em>
</p><p><em>“Padfoot? Sirius.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>No talking. Just story.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Ok, ok. On your phone, you start to text Prongs and Wormtail frantically, and in the darkness you hear their phones buzz, but their bodies don’t move. Suddenly, the shadow moves away from vision, and you strain to listen<br/> for it in the silent night.</em></p><p><em>“Then you feel a heavy drop at the foot of your bed, as if someone sat-</em>”</p><p>“<strong>AAHHH HOLY FUCKING SHIT HOUSE!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Padfoot?!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>JEEEEEEEEESUS CHRIST.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>There’s no need to be mocking.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>PRONGS YOU ABSOLUTE PRICK.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>What?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>YOU FUCKING DICK I’M GOING TO KILL YOU. I’m sorry Moony, Prongs just pulled on my foot because he’s a twat with no respect.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>At least you got scared, huh? Wasn’t that the aim?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Foot grabbing is cheating! And I’m going to be honest, I /was/ freaking a little from your stupid story. Did you really have to set it to where I am currently?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Maximum affect.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>No kidding. Oh god. Prongs won’t stop laughing. Moony? Oh no, not you too!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You squealed! Like I said you would!</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Stop laughing at me! Damn you, of course I squealed, I’m a big baby.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Big frightened baby. Big squeaky baby.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok, I get it! Baby!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Don’t get mad now, baby.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>The next time you call me ‘baby’ I’m taking it as a term of endearment-shut up Prongs!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I guess your whispering didn’t work then.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>No, amazingly. I guess I should go to bed now. It’s nearly midnight.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’ll talk to you later, Padfoot.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yeah. Cya, Remus.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Good night.</em>”</p><p>

</p><p>(12:23) <em>So the welcome home party is at Frank’s house and his mother is hilarious. </em></p><p>(12:24) <strong>Baby pictures?</strong></p><p>(12:24) <em>No, she just insults everyone whilst wearing a duck on her hat.</em></p><p>(12:25) <strong>Ducks are cute, Moony!

So if they aren’t fluro yellow, they’ll probably have Dora the Explorer on them.</em></p><p>(10:11) <strong>I can’t complain with that.</strong></p><p>(10:12) <em>Doesn’t make me intimidating for when I threaten to gutter stomp someone, though.</em></p><p>(10:12) <strong>…How often do you threaten to gutter stomp someone?</strong></p><p>(10:13) <em>Uh, Alice, yesterday.</em></p><p>(10:13) <strong>Wow, talk about intense.</strong></p><p>(10:14) <em>She was being very annoying, I promise.</em></p><p>(10:15) <strong>Damn, I’ll take your word for it.</strong></p><p>(10:16) <em>Alright, my stop is here.

</p><p>(12:38) <em>I’ve done it. I bought shoes that fit and aren’t children’s.

Well. First off, he’s a funny guy.</p><p>(1:32) <strong>DUH JAMES COME ON.</strong></p><p>(1:32) Well I just mean that when the guy was pestering him, he asked Moony who he was texting (which I assume was you) but he replied “Your dad, wondering when we can meet up and he can blow me.”</p><p>(1:33) <strong>HOLY SHIT</strong></p><p>(1:33) Yeah. But after that he was choking so that was the end of the one-liners.</p><p>(1:34) <strong>Ok I’m going to ask the obvious question.</strong></p><p>(1:34) What did he look like?</p><p>(1:35) <strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p>(1:35) Well, pretty much how he described. Pale. Thin. Green eyes and all that.</p><p>(1:36) So hey, you weren’t being catfished.</p><p>(1:36) <strong>Catfishing involves making yourself appear more attractive.</strong></p><p>(1:37) Well, I’m going to be honest, but he downplayed it A LOT.</p><p>(1:37) <strong>What do you mean?</strong></p><p>(1:38) Hang on.</p><p>(1:39) Lily says that he’s gorgeous in the way that he’s a shy-blushy type, but when he smiles it quickly becomes sexy.</p><p>(1:39) <strong>Yeah, but Lily’s dating you so I don’t exactly trust her judgment.</strong></p><p>(1:40) Trust mine. The guy’s hot.</p><p>(1:40) <strong>Ok good.</strong></p><p>(1:41) <strong>I mean, it doesn’t matter at all.</strong></p><p>(1:41) But it helps.</p><p>(1:42) <strong>It’s a good bonus.</strong></p><p>(1:42) <strong>Does he know he met /you/?</strong></p><p>(1:43) Yeah. I kinda… jumped out of the seat and hit Lily, shouting “it’s him.”</p><p>(1:43) <strong>Oh, so, subtle then?</strong></p><p>(1:44) Shut up.</p><p>(1:44) <strong>How did he take it?</strong></p><p>(1:45) He looked surprised. He didn’t really know what to say.</p><p>(1:45) Is he talking to you now?</p><p>(1:46) <strong>Nah, he said he should see a doctor and we’ll talk about it later.</strong></p><p>(1:46) Right.</p><p>(1:47) I’m sorry if I scared him away.</p><p>(1:48) <strong>I doubt you have. Don’t worry about it, man.</strong></p><p>(1:49) <strong>I guess… thanks for looking after him?</strong></p><p>(1:49) <strong>He said you offered to steal a car and drive him to the hospital.</strong></p><p>(1:50) Oh shit yeah that reminds me.</p><p>(1:50) <strong>Mm?</strong></p><p>(1:51) I… know what he has.</p><p>(1:51) <strong>His illness?</strong></p><p>(1:52) Yeah.</p><p>(1:53) <strong>Oh</strong></p><p>(1:53) <strong>I think that would breach the terms of our contract.</strong></p><p>(1:54) Padfoot, I think the contract might be off after this.</p><p>(1:54) <strong>We’ll see.</strong></p><p>(1:55) Do you want to meet him?</p><p>(1:56) <strong>Of course!</strong></p><p>(1:57) It’s ok if you don’t.</p><p>(1:57) <strong>I do.</strong></p><p>(1:58) Then?</p><p>(1:59) <strong>Well, obviously Prongs, I’m fucking scared.</strong></p><p>(2:00) Of what?</p><p>(2:00) <strong>…What if he thinks I’m annoying?</strong></p><p>(2:01) I was joking Sirius. You’re not annoying.</p><p>(2:02) <strong>But what if he thinks I am?</strong></p><p>(2:03) He won’t. Because you’re not.</p><p>(2:03) <strong>What if he thinks I’m weird</strong></p><p>(2:03) <strong>Or trying too hard</strong></p><p>(2:04) <strong>Or pretentious</strong></p><p>(2:04) <strong>Or an idiot</strong></p><p>(2:05) Padfoot! Stop!</p><p>(2:05) <strong>WHAT IF HE DOESN’T LIKE ME JAMES?</strong></p><p>(2:06) HE WILL LIKE YOU SIRIUS BECAUSE YOU’RE A LIKABLE PERSON AND YOU’RE AN AMAZING FRIEND WHO’S LOYAL AND FUNNY BUT ALSO WISE AND CARING AND please stop worrying Sirius. He likes you now and he’ll continue to like you when you meet. I swear to you.</p><p>(2:06) <strong>Honestly?</strong></p><p>(2:07) Hell, I’d even say seriously.</p><p>(2:07) <strong>Arsehole.</strong></p><p>(2:08) Punk ass loser.</p><p>(2:09) <strong>Thanks, Prongs.</strong></p><p>(2:09) S’oright. Now go get him.</p><p>(2:10) <strong>Never say that again.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

Until then, Prongs is really nice, and so’s his girlfriend, and I don’t think I properly said thank you. So if you could pass that on, that would be great. I’ll talk to you soon.

I could ask Prongs but I haven't.</strong></p><p>(9:05) <em>Oh. Why not?</em></p><p>(9:06) <strong>Didn't know if you would want me to.</strong></p><p>(9:06)<em> I always knew you would find out eventually.

Ok.</em></p><p>(9:09)<em> I have cystic fibrosis.</em></p><p>(9:10) <strong>I know.

Now what?</strong></p><p>(9:15)<em> I don't know. I'm still waiting results.

</p><p>(12:56) <em>I'm back in.</em></p><p>(12:57) <u><em><strong>But we all just got out!!! Unfair. What happened?</strong></em></u></p><p>(12:57) <em>Smoker on a bus.

  <u>Monday PM</u>
</p><p>(6:23) <em>I'm back to the shit food.</em></p><p>(6:24) <strong>Crying children?</strong></p><p>(6:24) <em>Not yet, but it's still early.</em></p><p>(6:24) <strong>Haha</strong></p><p>(6:25) <strong>How long do you reckon you'll need to stay there?</strong></p><p>(6:26) <em>Few days at most unless something tragic happens (I die of boredom) but then I get to be bed ridden for a few days after that.</em></p><p>(6:27) <strong>Woo movie marathon.</strong></p><p>(6:27) <em>I think by this point I have seen every film in existence.</em></p><p>(6:28) <strong>Even all the Alien renditions?</strong></p><p>(6:29) <em>Yes. And the Predator ones. Multiple times.</em></p><p>(6:29) <strong>Wow. I was kidding. Didn't think you'd be into that.</strong></p><p>(6:30) <em>There's something about a baby alien bursting out of someone's chest that's very satisfying.</em></p><p>(6:31) <strong>…Are we sure you're not the serial murderer?</strong></p><p>(6:32) <em>And what, my weapon of choice is aliens?</em></p><p>(6:32) <strong>Do you have aliens? Tell me now.</strong></p><p>(6:33) <em>Well, Sheba does look awfully suspicious.</em></p><p>(6:34) <strong>Are they the kind of goldfish with the big bulgy eyes?</strong></p><p>(6:34) <em>Yes.</em></p><p>(6:34) </p><p>

</p><p>(6:35)<strong> OH MY GOD IT'S A PICTURE OF SHEBA</strong></p><p>(6:36) <em>I've been meaning to send it to you. They have to stay at home while I'm here.</em></p><p>(6:37) <strong>So much for keeping you company.</strong></p><p>(6:37) <em>I know. We send each other smoke signals but it's just not the same.</em></p><p>(6:38) <strong>You should try doves. Very efficient.</strong></p><p>(6:39) <em>I'll keep it in mind.</em></p><p>(6:41) <strong>In second year they decided that Prongs, Wormtail, and I couldn't share a dorm so we were like "fine but we get to pick which dorm we ARE in"</strong></p><p>(6:42) <strong>So obviously we picked dorms right next to each other.</strong></p><p>(6:42) <em>It's like your teachers didn't even try.</em></p><p>(6:45) <strong>I know. Outside the building we set up a pulley system so a bucket could be transported the length of the three dorms. We also each had a bell outside the window with connecting strings so when the bucket arrived to a certain window we could ring their bell to let them know.</strong></p><p>(6:46) <em>Most people leave the room and sneak in.</em></p><p>(6:47) <strong>Yeah, but we were arseholes. It took the school months to figure out what the ringing bells in the middle of the night was.</strong></p><p>(6:48) <em>You guys were arseholes. So elaborate for something so minute.</em></p><p>(6:48) <strong>Hey, we got to share a dorm forever after that! Also started up some great rumours about a Bloody Mary in the school.</strong></p><p>(6:49) <em>Oh you would have loved that.</em></p><p>(6:50)<strong> I did. We dressed Wormtail up in a dirty white dress and sent him out on the school grounds for Halloween. Everyone screamed. It was amazing.</strong></p><p>(6:51) <em>No, no. You are definitely the serial murderer.</em></p><p>(6:52) <strong>We could be murder husbands.</strong></p><p>(6:52) <em>Murder husbands? Is that a thing?</em></p><p>(6:52) <strong>Sure. It is now.</strong></p><p>(6:53) <em>If this is your proposal, it sucks.</em></p><p>(6:54) <strong>REMUS LUPIN I CAN'T FIND A REASON TO LIVE AND KILL WITHOUT YOU. WOULD YOU DO ME THE GREATEST HONOUR AND HAVE MY HAND IN MARRIAGE?? SAY YES OR I'LL MURDER YOU.</strong></p><p>(6:55) <em>I guess you leave me no choice</em></p><p>(6:55) <em>But to kill you first.</em></p><p>(6:56) <strong>I'd like to see you try.</strong></p><p>(6:56) <em>It wouldn't be very exciting. I would probably poison you.</em></p><p>(6:57) <strong>Poison? Cop out.</strong></p><p>(6:57) <em>I'm not very physically strong. Poison it is.</em></p><p>(6:57) <strong>I'll be wary of drinks left around you then.</strong></p><p>(6:59) <em>When we were 15, Frank, Alice and I used to make paper airplanes and throw them to each other with a message.</em></p><p>(7:00) <strong>That sounds a lot easier than our pulley system.</strong></p><p>(7:01) <em>Definitely. Frank's messages were mostly dicks though, and Alice kept writing limericks.</em></p><p>(7:02) <strong>Any memorable ones?</strong></p><p>(7:03) <em>Not really. All the ballsack to penis ratios were very inaccurate.</em></p><p>(7:03) <strong>…I meant the limericks.</strong></p><p>(7:04) <em>I know.</em></p><p>(7:04) <em>One of the nurses happened to find one written about her so naturally it's burned into my head.</em></p><p>(7:05) <strong>Oh god yes</strong></p><p>(7:06) <em>"There once was a nurse named Pince</em></p><p>(7:06) <em>Who's needle jabbing would make you wince</em></p><p>(7:06) <em>When asked "What's the deal?"</em></p><p>(7:06) <em>She'd let out a squeal</em></p><p>(7:06) <em>And we haven't really been the same since."</em></p><p>(7:07) <em>Based on a true story. She hates us now.</em></p><p>(7:08) <strong>Oh my god</strong></p><p>(7:09) <em>She was scary before this happened.</em></p><p>(7:09) <strong>Do you just spend all your time pissing off nurses?</strong></p><p>(7:09) <em>I don't mean to! She was never meant to see the limerick.</em></p><p>(7:10) <strong>The curse of the dreaded limerick.</strong></p><p>(7:11) <em>Ah, and the revenge of the nurse. She's yelling at me to get off 'that god-awful gadget'.</em></p><p>(7:11) <strong>Sometimes I forget that I'm talking to you through a phone.</strong></p><p>(7:12) <em>Well, it's definitely not morse code.</em></p><p>(7:12) <strong>Not what I meant.</strong></p><p>(7:13) <em>I know. And yeah, I get what you mean. This might be weird but - sometimes it feels like you're beside me and talking to me.</em></p><p>(7:14)<strong> I like to pretend that you're here talking to me. Even though I'm in the dining hall.</strong></p><p>(7:14) <em>Oh, it's a HALL is it? How grand.</em></p><p>(7:16) <strong>Shush! And it's not 'grand,' it's great. It's the Great Hall.</strong></p><p>(7:16) <em>I have a bed tray.

</p><p>(9:45) <strong>This might be weird but</strong></p><p>(9:45) <strong>And this isn't some ego thing</strong></p><p>(9:45) <strong>But, uh...</strong></p><p>(9:46) <em>Come on, Sirius, spit it out.</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>How do you imagine me?</strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>Oh. Um.</em></p><p>(9:47) <em>It's probably entirely wrong.</em></p><p>(9:48) <strong>Well, then, I'll let you down gently. Come on!</strong></p><p>(9:50) <em>Fine. Ok. So it's something like… long hair. Like, touching your shoulders? And black. And this is embarrassing.</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>Woah, dude, you're actually right so far.</strong></p><p>(9:52) <em>You're kidding.</em></p><p>(9:52) <strong>Nope. Keep going.</strong></p><p>(9:54) <em>I told you I was psychic.</em></p><p>(9:55) <strong>If it adds, I have to wear my hair as a bun when I'm playing.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>You definitely have to be kidding now.</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>Again: Nope.</strong></p><p>(9:56) <em>This is incredible.</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>What?</strong></p><p>(9:56) <em>Nothing.</em></p><p>(9:57) <em>Leather jacket as casual wear and some big threatening boots.</em></p><p>(9:57) <strong>Threatening?</strong></p><p>(9:59) <em>The kinds of shoes I would wear when I wanted to threaten to gutter stomp someone.</em></p><p>(10:00) <strong>Ahhh. Gotcha.</strong></p><p>(10:01) <strong>Also very accurate.</strong></p><p>(10:01) <em>Wow. I should do card readings.</em></p><p>(10:02) <em>Your turn, then.</em></p><p>(10:03) <strong>I have the upper hand of having first account witnesses to the beauty that is Remus Lupin.</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>That's stretching it.</em></p><p>(10:04) <strong>Nonsense. I have been greatly reassured by both Evans and Prongs that you're one hot motherfucker.</strong></p><p>(10:04) <em>Oh Christ no</em></p><p>(10:04) <em>They lied</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>They would never! I'm frankly starting to consider you to be an unreliable narrator, Moony.</strong></p><p>(10:05) <em>But, but… /glasses/</em></p><p>(10:06) <strong>Oh yeah. AND APPARENTLY CARDIGANS?</strong></p><p>(10:06) <em>Oh fuck no this is too much.</em></p><p>(10:07) <strong>The punk and the dork. What a pair we make.</strong></p><p>(10:07) <em>We sound like the worst sitcom ever.</em></p><p>(10:08)<strong> It provides for an ultimate comedy duo! Although admittedly, Prongs might be a bit jealous of that.</strong></p><p>(10:09) <em>I suppose you two are the comedy kids.</em></p><p>(10:10) <strong>The jokers of the class! Speaking of which, we must prepare for phase one of Operation Salt. I'll talk to you later.</strong></p><p>(10:10) <em>What is Operation Salt? Do I really want to know?</em></p><p>(10:11) <strong>I told you, I'll tell you how it goes when we're finished. Relax, Moony, it's not like you're going to get into trouble.</strong></p><p>(10:12) <em>Yes, but I won't have much to do over here if you get your phone revoked (again)</em></p><p>(10:12)<strong> I can assure you that if you stop messaging me now then my phone won't be revoked.</strong></p><p>(10:13) <em>Fine. Don't get caught.</em></p><p>(10:13) <strong>That's the spirit.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(10:45) <strong>Lily, are you in position?</strong></p><p>(10:46) <u><em>-I thought we agreed on code names, Black.-</em></u></p><p>(10:46) <strong>In that case, Evans, start using mine.</strong></p><p>(10:47) <u><em>-Yes, Padfoot, I am in position.-</em></u></p><p>(10:47) <strong>Excellent work, Redhind. Prongs, update on your front?</strong></p><p>(10:48) Good. I have my hand firmly situated over Wormy's mouth so he doesn't squeal.</p><p>(10:49) <u>Is this really necessary?! We could be expelled!</u></p><p>(10:50) <strong>We've already told you, Wormtail! You won't get convicted for this. You used your free pass.</strong></p><p>(10:50) Dodgy time to use your one and only free pass, though, when your best mate needed you most.</p><p>(10:50) <u>Sirius, I love you, but this is going too far, mate.</u></p><p>(10:51) <u><em>-Boys, you can squabble later! Do I do it? Now??-</em></u></p><p>(10:51) <strong>YES REDHIND. INITIATE PHASE ONE OPERATION SALT: NOW!</strong></p><p>(10:51) <em><u>-Here goes nothing.-</u></em></p><p>(10:54) This is excruciating.</p><p>(10:54) <strong>Prongs, if you fuck this up bc you got territorial I will rip your throat out with my teeth.</strong></p><p>(10:55) <u>I reckon Redhind would do it first, mind.</u></p><p>(10:56) <strong>PRONGS YOU'RE IN GO GO GO.</strong></p><p>(10:57) <u>This is terrible. I'm so anxious.</u></p><p>(10:57) <strong>Wormy, you're not even doing anything.</strong></p><p>(10:58) <u>But still! I don't want all my friends to go to jail.</u></p><p>(10:58) <strong>We won't be put into jail!</strong></p><p>(10:59) <u>No, just life long detention. And really, what's the difference?</u></p><p>(11:01) <u><em>-What's this about prison?-</em></u></p><p>(11:01) <strong>REDHIND YOU'RE ALIVE. HOW'D IT GO?</strong></p><p>(11:02) <u><em>-I got the details. His number is saved onto my phone. Do we tell Prongs that he can stop talking to him now?-</em></u></p><p>(11:02) <strong>Nah, he looks like he's going to cry from boredom. I wanna see how far he takes this.</strong></p><p>(11:03) <u>He is risking his life for you. You might want to be kind to him.</u></p><p>(11:03) <strong>Wormtail! Stop this! No one is dying or being sent to prison. Just shush.</strong></p><p>(11:04) <u>Whatever. I'm not bailing you guys, is all I'm saying.</u></p><p>(11:10) Really, Padfoot, you were just gonna let him talk to me for half an hour?</p><p>(11:10) <strong>It was fifteen minutes. Relax.</strong></p><p>(11:11) Redhind, I hear you were successful?</p><p>(11:12) <em><u>-Phase one is complete. Mission accomplished, gentlemen.-</u></em></p><p>(11:12) <strong>Hey, that's my line!</strong></p><p>(11:13)<u><em> -Very well.-</em></u></p><p>(11:13) <strong>PHASE ONE IS COMPLETE. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, COMRADES. TOMORROW WE SHALL PROCEED. I'LL SEE YOU THERE.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Tuesday PM</u>
</p><p>(5:34) <em>Still alive, I hope?</em></p><p>(5:35) <strong>Wow, you and Wormtail are insistent on the pessimism of the operation.</strong></p><p>(5:35)<em> I've started a eulogy. Just wanted to know if I could carry on.</em></p><p>(5:36) <strong>Carry on, by all means. You won't be needing it anytime soon, however.</strong></p><p>(5:36) <em>So the operation went on without a hitch?</em></p><p>(5:37) <strong>Not a single one. It was beautiful. So smooth and elegant.</strong></p><p>(5:37) <em>Do I get to hear about it or must I wait until the whole operation is complete?</em></p><p>(5:38) <strong>Hm… I can tell you each phase. Today was the preliminary stage. Preparations. The real deal starts tomorrow.</strong></p><p>(5:39) <em>And what did you do today?</em></p><p>(5:40)<strong> I acquired the teacher's - Slughorn's - phone number.</strong></p><p>(5:41) <em>Your flirting knows no bounds.</em></p><p>(5:42) <strong>Ew no. No, no, no. Redhind did the flirting.</strong></p><p>(5:42) <strong>Sorry, uh, Prongs' girlfriend.</strong></p><p>(5:43) <em>This is a gang. You have initiated someone else into the gang through means of nicknaming.</em></p><p>(5:43) <strong>She thought it would be appropriate that we had code names, what with it being a top secret mission and all.</strong></p><p>(5:43) <em>Redhind?</em></p><p>(5:44) <strong>You've met her.</strong></p><p>(5:44) <em>Your creative input then?</em></p><p>(5:45) <strong>Oh, yes. I am the nicknaming master, after all.</strong></p><p>(5:45) <em>Ok then. You had an underage girl flirt with your chemistry teacher. How legal is all this?</em></p><p>(5:45) <strong>That's probably the most legal thing we'll do, actually. Since Slughorn would be the one convicted. Hey, maybe I could just report him for vile conduct towards students.</strong></p><p>(5:45) <em>That would be the mature thing to do.</em></p><p>(5:46) <strong>Naaaaah. They'd just let him off. He's never actually done anything. Anyway, Redhind was able to flirt her way into the storage cupboard so she could muck around with the experiment we were doing.</strong></p><p>(5:46) <strong>I should add that she's already a favourite of his bc she's really good at chemistry. And everything else for that matter.</strong></p><p>(5:46) <em>Prongs sounds lucky.</em></p><p>(5:47) <strong>Yeah, and you can bet your arse that it's all entirely out of luck.</strong></p><p>(5:48) <em>So, what did she do in the cupboard?</em></p><p>(5:49) <strong>Well, it also doubles as his office. He keeps his things in there while he teaches. Including his phone. So Redhind simply texted her number from his phone and wala. Phone number.</strong></p><p>(5:49) <strong>Prongs called him over for help as a decoy. It was wonderful to watch. The man just doesn't shut up.</strong></p><p>(5:50) <em>Does he not password protect his phone?</em></p><p>(5:50) <strong>Apparently not. What a dickhead. He lives in a building with hundreds of teenagers. He needs all the security he can get.</strong></p><p>(5:51) <em>So what happens now?</em></p><p>(5:51) <strong>That's for me to know and you to find out, Moony. All in due time.</strong></p><p>(5:51) <em>You said something about this being the most legal part of the operation...</em></p><p>(5:51) <strong>Don't you worry your pretty little head over it. We've spent an entire weekend going over the details. It'll be fine.</strong></p><p>(5:52) <em>Are you sure?</em></p><p>(5:52) <strong>Absolutely.</strong></p><p>(5:53) <strong>If I were to go to jail, would you write to me every day?</strong></p><p>(5:54) <em>Every second day. I don't want to look clingy.</em></p><p>(5:55) <strong>Would you send photographs?</strong></p><p>(5:56) <em>As long as you promise not to share them with Big Bob the Cell Mate.</em></p><p>(5:56) <strong>I'd keep them tucked under my pillow.</strong></p><p>(5:57) <em>Would you kiss them goodnight?</em></p><p>(5:57) <strong>Oh of course, Moony. I'm not heartless.</strong></p><p>(5:57) <em>That's good to hear. I'll go prepare the folio.</em></p><p>(5:59) <strong>Make them extra saucy.</strong></p><p>(6:00) <em>Still not a good enough excuse to use the word 'saucy'.</em></p><p>(6:01) <strong>Touche.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Wednesday AM</u>
</p><p>(10:24) <em>I get out tomorrow.</em></p><p>(10:25) <strong><em><u>Hey, that wasn't so bad.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:25) <em>Yeah, I know. They even think I could go for walks.</em></p><p>(10:25) <strong><em><u>Oh, excellent!</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:26) <em>Yes, I knew you would be excited.</em></p><p>(10:27) <strong><em><u>So this begs the real, pressing question...</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:27) <em>Yes?</em></p><p>(10:28) <strong><em><u>DOES THIS MEAN YOU'LL SEE HIM THIS WEEKEND?</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:28) <em>God, Alice! If I didn't know any better, I would think you wanted to meet up with him.</em></p><p>(10:28) <strong><em><u>Well, if you're offering I come along I would not protest.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:29) <em>Weirdo. You have Frank. Stick to your own.</em></p><p>(10:30) <strong><em><u>Like you can talk.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:31) <em>???</em></p><p>(10:31) <strong><em><u>Nothing. Why won't you see him this weekend?</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:33) <em>I can walk, but I can't run.</em></p><p>(10:33) <em>What did you mean by that?</em></p><p>(10:34) <u><em><strong>Nothing. I'm sure meeting up with him for lunch won't be too tiring.</strong></em></u></p><p>(10:34) <em>Alice stop trying to change the subject.</em></p><p>(10:35) <strong><em><u>It was nothing, really. I think if anything, you're trying to change the subject.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:35) <em>Yeah, because that was a strange thing to say.</em></p><p>(10:36) <strong><em><u>It was just a joke.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:37) <em>And what was the basis of that joke?!</em></p><p>(10:37) <strong><em><u>You're being paranoid.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:37) <em>You're being cryptic.</em></p><p>(10:39) <strong><em><u>Look, I wasn't going to mention it because Frank suggested not to.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:40) <em>Mention what??</em></p><p>(10:40) <strong><em><u>Now you're being cryptic.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:42) <em>I want to be sure we're on the same page, is all.</em></p><p>(10:45) <strong><em><u>Frank told me that you kissed him.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:50) <strong><em><u>Remus? Is it true?</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:52) <em>Were those the words he used?</em></p><p>(10:52) <strong><em><u>What does it matter!</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:53) <em>It does, ok! Did he tell you context?!</em></p><p>(10:53) <strong><u><em>No, I didn't ask for the details of my best friend kissing my boyfriend!</em></u></strong></p><p>(10:55) <em>He wasn't your boyfriend at the time.</em></p><p>(10:56) <strong><em><u>Wow, is that meant to make me feel better!!</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:57) <em>No, it means he hasn't told you the whole thing!</em></p><p>(10:58) <strong><em><u>I don't want to know! This is why I didn't mention it, because I knew you would get weird.</u></em></strong></p><p>(10:59) <em>I'm not being weird! I just want you to know that it's not as weird as you might think it is.</em></p><p>(11:01) <strong><em><u>No, it's still pretty weird.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:02) <em>That's because you're not letting me explain.</em></p><p>(11:03) <strong><em><u>I don't want you to explain it. It's done. It's dead or whatever.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:04) <strong><u><em>Meet up with Lover Boy. Let it die, Remus.</em></u></strong></p><p>(11:04) <em>It is well and truly dead, Alice.

  <u>Wednesday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(12:12) <strong>Phase two has begun. No reaction thus far but I'm a patient man.</strong></p><p>(12:15) <em>What's phase two?</em></p><p>(12:16) <strong>I'm glad you asked, Moony!</strong></p><p>(12:16) <strong>Phase two is when the texting begins.</strong></p><p>(12:18) <em>I'm not following.</em></p><p>(12:19) <strong>Oh, Moony, I trusted your clever wits to work it out.</strong></p><p>(12:20) <em>Not now. What's phase two?</em></p><p>(12:21) <strong>Well, we possess a phone number. When you had your little altercation with the dickweed smoker, Prongs and Redhind were purchasing throw away phones.</strong></p><p>(12:22) <em>You're great plan is to text him?</em></p><p>(12:22) <strong>This is only phase two, Moony. Have faith.</strong></p><p>(12:24) <em>Mm.</em></p><p>(12:24) <strong>What's the matter?</strong></p><p>(12:25) <em>Don't worry about it. What kind of things are you texting him?</em></p><p>(12:25) <strong>We are trying to gage what his interests may be. Would he like to subscribe to sexting with a foxy young blonde, brunette, or ginger? We really hope it's not the last one or we may need to pull Redhind out of school.</strong></p><p>(12:27) <strong>If he consents to flirting with one of our serviced beauties, we progress to phase three. But that's for another day.</strong></p><p>(12:27) <em>This just sounds a little strange so far.</em></p><p>(12:28) <strong>Trust me Remus, we have bigger plans.</strong></p><p>(12:28) <strong>Now: What's wrong?</strong></p><p>(12:30) <em>Alice is angry with me.</em></p><p>(12:31) <strong>Why?</strong></p><p>(12:31) <em>She knows about the Frank thing, but she also doesn't really know about the Frank thing, and will refuse to let me explain it.</em></p><p>(12:33) <strong>What does she think she knows?</strong></p><p>(12:33) <em>Frank told her that I kissed him, but nothing about the whole dare thing. She didn't even know it was before they were together, so I can only imagine what Frank led her to believe.</em></p><p>(12:33) <strong>Frank is sounding less and less likeable.</strong></p><p>(12:35) <em>Yeah, I know what you mean. They both, apparently, think I fancy him though.</em></p><p>(12:35) <strong>But you don't?</strong></p><p>(12:35) <em>Of course not! Jeez. I thought of all people you would know that.</em></p><p>(12:36) <strong>Just. Just making sure. Clarification and all that.</strong></p><p>(12:36) <em>Feeling insecure?</em></p><p>(12:38) <strong>SIRIUS BLACK NEVER FEELS INSECURE. UNLESS IT'S A BAD HAIR DAY.</strong></p><p>(12:38) <em>How's today looking?</em></p><p>(12:39) <strong>As dashing as ever. I had sport this morning so I put it up in a bun (your favourite).</strong></p><p>(12:40) <em>Yeah, yeah, ok.</em></p><p>(12:41) <strong>Don't deny it, I can see right through you.</strong></p><p>(12:41) <em>Shush now.</em></p><p>(12:43)<strong> You're blushing aren't you?</strong></p><p>(12:44) <em>I am going to utilise the power of lying texting presents to me by saying, no absolutely not.</em></p><p>(12:44) <strong>I knew it.</strong></p><p>(12:45) <strong>So what are you going to do about Alice?</strong></p><p>(12:46) <em>I don't know. I don't know if I should talk to Frank to clear this up. I don't know if I should do it now or see them tomorrow.</em></p><p>(12:46) <strong>Like, in person?</strong></p><p>(12:47) <em>Oh, yeah. Um, I'm being released home tomorrow.</em></p><p>(12:47) <strong>Right. Well. Maybe it's a face-to-face conversation?</strong></p><p>(12:49) <em>Probably.</em></p><p>(12:50) <em>I'm never drinking or kissing ever again. Too much trouble.</em></p><p>(12:51) <strong>Now don't say that! You'll break my heart.</strong></p><p>(12:52) <em>I won't do the two things at the same time again?</em></p><p>(12:52) <strong>Better. Sounds more promising.</strong></p><p>(12:54) <em>Promising?</em></p><p>(12:54) <strong>Mhm.

He got the scolding of his life.</em></p><p>(11:51) <strong>Least he deserves. Really, Moony, if I ever meet that boy...</strong></p><p>(11:53) <em>You'll kill him, I know.</em></p><p>(11:53) <em>He apologised and everything.

But yeah we have set up a small sexting service for him. Phase three begins tomorrow.</strong></p><p>(12:02) <em>Padfoot… Are you actually texting him things?</em></p><p>(12:04) <strong>Yeah. It's disturbing, to say the least. He likes it when I call him big boy.</strong></p><p>(12:05) <em>Oh my god I don't need to know.</em></p><p>(12:05) <strong>Feeling insecure?</strong></p><p>(12:06) <em>Feeling grossed out.</em></p><p>(12:07) <strong>I could call you big boy if you wanted.</strong></p><p>(12:07) <em>Fuck off.</em></p><p>(12:09) <strong>No? Something sweet then? I could go back to pumpkin and sweetheart.</strong></p><p>(12:09) <em>Yeah, when we mentally age to 80.</em></p><p>(12:10) <strong>Don't say it like that, dear.</strong></p><p>(12:10) <strong>Ok, ok, maybe something more modern.

I CAN FLIRT MY WAY INTO ANYTHING."</p><p>(3:23) <strong>I do not doubt my abilities. I am thoroughly weirded out though. I need a break.</strong></p><p>(3:23) I don't want to do it.</p><p>(3:23) <strong>PRONGS PLEASE. HELP A BROTHER OUT.</strong></p><p>(3:24) No, this was your idea.</p><p>(3:24) <strong>Come on, just do it for an hour, tops. Please, mate.</strong></p><p>(3:26) I expect to be paid for this.</p><p>(3:26) <strong>You will. Heavily. And Lily.</strong></p><p>(3:26) Why Lily?</p><p>(3:27) <strong>You'll see why when you start texting him.</strong></p><p>(3:27) THIS ISN'T A FETISH THING ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND IS IT?????</p><p>(3:39) <strong>GOD, NO NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT</strong></p><p>(3:39) <strong>JUST</strong></p><p>(3:39) <strong>YOU'LL SEE.</strong></p><p>(3:40) I'm scared. I demand great compensation.</p><p>(3:40) <strong>You'll get it. I swear to you Prongs, you'll get your reward.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(5:34) PADFOOT!!!!!!</p><p>(5:35) <strong>Yes Jamesy?</strong></p><p>(5:35) THIS WAS A TRAP!!! YOU'VE RUINED EVERYTHING!!</p><p>(5:35) <strong>Don't be so dramatic</strong></p><p>(5:36) <strong>I mean, I know it's bad, but it's not /that bad/</strong></p><p>(5:36) NO IT IS THAT BAD</p><p>(5:36) I WAS WITH LILY</p><p>(5:37) LIKE /WITH LILY/</p><p>(5:37) AND THEN THE FUCKER TEXTS ME</p><p>(5:37) "HEY BABE WAT U UP 2"</p><p>(5:37) MAKING OUT!!! WITH MY GIRLFRIEND!!!! WELL NOT ANYMORE!!</p><p>(5:38) <strong>I told you I'd pay compensation!</strong></p><p>(5:38) CAN YOU COMPENSATE FOR ME AN EVENING OF EMBARRASSMENT?? LILY WOULDN'T STOP LAUGHING</p><p>(5:39) <strong>That's more your poor choice in women.</strong></p><p>(5:39) YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN</p><p>(5:39) <strong>Yeah</strong></p><p>(5:40) <strong>Well</strong></p><p>(5:40) <strong>Trying to flirt with Moony just makes me feel weird now</strong></p><p>(5:40) I know what you mean. I feel tainted.</p><p>(5:41) Soooooooooo</p><p>(5:41) We're admitting you flirt with him now?</p><p>(5:41) <strong>Shut up.</strong></p><p>(5:42) You're a little boy with a little boy crush.</p><p>(5:42) <strong>Do I need to remind you of all the embarrassing things you said and did before Lily took pity on you?</strong></p><p>(5:42) Noooooooope. Because it's irrelevant. You're the 'cool' one, or so you keep saying.</p><p>(5:43) <strong>I am the cool one. At least I haven't told him I love him.</strong></p><p>(5:43) I was twelve, it doesn't count.</p><p>(5:44) <strong>It so counts</strong></p><p>(5:44) Does not. Does he flirt back?</p><p>(5:46) <strong>In his own way, I think he does. Mostly he just tells me to shut up.</strong></p><p>(5:46) You two are adorable.</p><p>(5:47) <strong>I will set you on fire.</strong></p><p>(5:47) Come get your dirty phone. I don't want it near me anymore.</p><p>(5:47) <strong>Fine.</strong></p><p>(5:47) BRING MARSHMALLOWS.</p><p>(5:48) <strong>Where am I going to get marshmallows???</strong></p><p>(5:48) Kitchen.</p><p>(5:48) <strong>You want me to break into the kitchens?!</strong></p><p>(5:49) You said compensation.</p><p>(5:49) <strong>Arsehole.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <em> <strong>[Calling Moony]</strong> </em>
</p><p>"<em>Erhh?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Moonbeam!</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Sirius, what the fuck- it's midnight, what the hell?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Slughorn won't stop texting me. The guy doesn't sleep, Moony.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Apparently neither do I.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I'm reaching a breaking point. I don't think my imagination can keep up with him.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>I really don't want to know.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>No, but I need your help!</strong>"</p><p>"<em>I am not helping you get off some middle aged creep.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>What if I paid you?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Stop whoring me out!</em>"</p><p>"<strong>It worked on Prongs.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Well, he's easy then, isn't he?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>You play hard to get. I see how it is.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>I'm playing dead. I am sleeping.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Noooo, Moony, come on. Just a few more minutes. If I'm alone with this guy I think I might jump out the window.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>What do you think, Sheba, do we let Sirius jump out of the window? … They say yes.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Lies. I heard them distinctly say, 'No, Moony, why on Earth would you suggest such a thing?' Sheba isn't a monster.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>…Sheba says you're a dick.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Stop turning Sheba against me!</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Sheba prefers me and you know it.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>We should have never divorced. It's ruined Sheba.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>They're happy you've moved out. They couldn't take the drunkenness anymore.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I'll see you in court, Remus. I will get Sheba back.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Over my dead body.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Oh no.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>What?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>He wants a picture.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Tell him that breaches the terms of agreement.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>You're a genius.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>I know. Hey, Sirius?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Mm?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>How… How come you've never asked me for a picture?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I'm not really going to jail, Remus, I don't need pin-up shots for lonely nights.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>You know what I mean. Surely you're… curious, or whatever.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Are you?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Yes.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Then how come you haven't asked me for pictures?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>I'm curious not… scared. Or anything.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Scared of… me being weird looking?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Yeah. I mean, it's not a concern of mine. No one can fake confidence like that without knowing their hot.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>And you think it would be a concern of mine?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Yes.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>How could you possibly think that!?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Oh, no, not like - I'm not scared you think I'm weird looking because you're snob but - but, I don't know, because I think I'm weird looking, so.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I wouldn't care even if you looked like Simon Cowell.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>That's… is that meant to be reassuring?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>The guy looks like a foot, and his personality isn't much better.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Right. That's a fair observation, actually.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I… I think I know what I am.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>What you are? Human, surely.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>No, no, just - hey, shut up!</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Hah, I know what you mean, Sirius! Go on, then.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Still testing the waters though, just not in the way you've previously suggested.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Ok.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>And it's just… so far this is what I've figured out.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>You don't have to retain the title forever, Sirius. You can come and go as you please.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Alright. That makes me feel better.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Ok then.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Ok.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Are you going to tell me?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Yes.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>You've not said it aloud yet, have you?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>No, I haven't. What if it turns out I have been mispronouncing it wrong all along and - not only may I be misidentifying myself, but I also can't even say the word.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>If you don't want to say, then you don't have to, Padfoot.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I want to say it. It's important in reassuring you.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Reassuring me? This is about you, you don't-</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Pansexual. I think. So far.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>I… elaborate.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I like the person. Personality and all that. Not the gender or sex or looks. It's what's on the inside that counts, and all that crap.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>So as long as the person is awesome, personality wise, the rest is just unimportant?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>It's unimportant to how I feel about the person, yeah. So you could be a girl, boy, both, neither, sometimes one and sometimes the other, you know. There are so many genders, Moony. Did you know there were so many genders? It's awesome."</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>Padfoot.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Right, right. The point is, I like you, Moony.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>Oh.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Haha, yeah. Oh.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>So as long as I look like Simon Cowell but am not acting like Simon Cowell, that's all good for you?</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Uh huh. Doesn't mean I can't appreciate how hot you actually are, though.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>Oh my god.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Really, I just hit a jackpot.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>Stop, you're being embarrassing again!</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>One day you'll flirt back.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>You should be flirting with Slughorn.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>I think he fell asleep.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>I wonder what that's like.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Fine, fine, I'll shut up.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>Oh, I like it when you talk Padfoot, just not at… one in the morning.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>I'll keep it in mind.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>You say that, but I doubt you will do it.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>No, you're right.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>There's no point lying to me Sirius Black, I can see right through it.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Wow, we sound married.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>At least we acknowledge it. Good night, sweet cakes.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>That's my bit.</strong>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<em>Hang up the phone.</em>"</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>"<strong>Sleep tight, love.</strong>"</p><p>

  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:23) <strong>Phase three has been launched.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:25) <em>I can't read right now, some arsehole woke me up at an ungodly hour and so now I am dead.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:25) <strong>And you say I'm the drama queen!</strong></p><p>

  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:26) <em>OH MY SWEETEST MOONY I WOULD LOVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW BUT ALAS, I HAVE BEEN RENDERED LAME, AS MY BRAIN HAS TURNED TO ASH AND BILE FROM FATIGUE AS SOME NITWIT DECIDED TO CALL ME AT THE CRACK OF SATAN'S ASS.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:27) <strong>I showed this to Prongs and he says this is accurate.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:27) <em>You're so predictable. What's phase three, then?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:29) <strong>Phase three is using the three other throw away phones Prongs and Redhind bought to text him about different services.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:29) <strong>Like… spam emails for sexting services. Soon he'll become annoyed and I imagine he'll try to unsubscribe.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:31) <em>What happens when he tries to unsubscribe?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:31) <strong>That's phase four, Moony, don't get ahead of yourself.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:33) <em>Very well.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:33) <em>What if he goes along with it? Like, all of the four sexters.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:35) <em>Surely a man his age doesn't have that much stamina.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:35) <strong>That's what I'm banking on. If I have to keep going on with this, I might as well start charging him and create a business from this.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:37) <em>I hesitate to ask but… are you any good?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:37) <strong>Do you want to find out first hand?</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:39) <em>No thank you, I think it might just breach my comfort zone right now.</em></p><p>

</p><p>(10:39) <strong>If you say so. I must be, I guess. I mean, he keeps replying. Boy, does he keep replying.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(10:41) <em>I'll let you two be alone, then. I have Wii Fitness I must attend to.</em></p><p>

  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:43) <em>Ok.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:50) <em>That means ask the question, Padfoot.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:52) <strong>I'm trying to formulate how I'm going to ask.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:52) <em>What's the basis of the question and I'll figure it out.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:54)<strong> I know what illness you have.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:54)<em> Ah.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:54) <em>When are we meeting?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:56) <strong>I still want to. Obviously.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:56) <em>Yeah, me too, me too.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:57) <em>Um. I don't know. I don't think I physically can this weekend.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:57) <strong>And I have school during the week.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:58) <strong>So maybe next weekend?</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:58) <strong>If it's not, um, too short notice.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:58) <em>No it should be fine. It is fine.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:59) <strong>On Saturday? I have a game on Sunday.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:59) <em>Yeah that's good. I guess we'll go into details closer to the day?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:00) <strong>Yeah that's a good idea.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:02) <em>Cool. Ok.</em></p><p>

</p><p>(7:03) <strong>Ok. Wow. I just wanted to make sure it was still an ok thing to do.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:03) <em>Yeah, yeah of course.</em></p><p>

</p><p>(7:04) <strong>Alright.</strong></p><p>

</p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:51) <em>I'm watching Jurassic Park.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:53) <strong>What… for the first time?</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:53) <em>Since I was a kid, yeah.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:53) <em>Stupid premise for a movie.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:54) <strong>Dinosaurs aren't stupid, Remus! How dare you.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:54) <em>Who would logically think that genetically recreating dinosaurs would be a good idea? And then marooning them on an island? I just don't understand.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:56) <strong>But think of the adventure!</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:56) <em>I don't need to, it's playing right out in front of me. People die.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:58) <strong>You must be a blast at the cinemas.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:58) <em>Don't worry, I usually reserve my comments until the film is over.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:58)<strong> I suppose I take some comfort in that.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(6:59) <em>I do eat all the popcorn though.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:01) <strong>We'll buy a big bucket then.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:02) <strong>Is this how to spend your Saturday nights?</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:03) <em>Watching terrible but classic movies? Yes. Pretty much.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:03) <strong>Damn Remus, you need to get out.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:05) <em>And do what? Imagine me at a night club.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:05) <strong>I'm imagining glitter and neon.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:06) <em>Well you would be incorrect. I'm obviously more a leather kind of homo.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:06) <strong>Oh Christ</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:07) <em>And pray tell what you're doing on a Saturday night?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:08) <strong>It's some snob's birthday, so we're at a bonfire thing by a lake.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:08) <em>Don't those usually occur at the beach?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:10) <strong>Yeah, but we're no where near a beach. So the lake had to do.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:10) <em>So you're at a bonfire but you still text me about Jurassic Park?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:12) <strong>Jurassic Park is cool, Moony.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:13) <em>More interesting than a bonfire party, huh?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:13) <strong>Yep. There are only so many marshmallows you can toast before it becomes tedious.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:15) <em>How long until a person is thrown into the fire?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:16) <strong>Oo, tasty. I don't suspect long. Most of them have been drinking.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:17) <strong>Oh, and you're worst nightmare Moony. Someone has suggested truth or dare.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:17) <em>You're not drinking are you?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:18) <strong>I'm not drunk.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:18) <em>Lucky. Don't want any mishaps.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:18) <em>Have there been any mishaps? Since Slughorn read out the messages.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:19) <strong>Oh. Ah, yeah, I've been disowned.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:19) <em>WHAT</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:19) <strong>It's no big deal. Long overdue, really.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:20) <em>No, Sirius, what happened?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:20) <strong>Oh it was very formal and very cold. She wrote me a letter saying that they don't want me home anymore and that I shouldn't talk to Regulus lest I soil him.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:20) <strong>I really don't care, Moony. I'm glad it's over with.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:21)<em> I guess it's better than the alternative.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:21) <strong>?</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:21) <em>Correction Camp.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:23) <strong>Oh. Yeah. Way better then.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:23) <em>And what about everyone else?</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:25) <strong>Reg and his friends are dicks, but it's not like they're worse. They just use different words now.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:26) <strong>I guess Prongs told his parents though because they phoned me and told me they were cool with it.</strong></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:27) <em>Oh that's good. That's great.</em></p><p>
  <strong></strong>
</p><p>(7:27)<strong> Yeah, they're fantastic people.</strong></p><p>

</p><p>
  <strong>Dear Remus,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I couldn’t let this opportunity pass without writing to you. Just a different form of media to message you, right? I don't think you’ve seen the crop circles I’ve left for you.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Your phone contact is called May-Sue. You’re blonde, double D, like it up the backside. I will refuse to make an anal joke here.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>He’ll usually text at break and lunch, which is 10:30-10:50 and then 12:00-1:00. But you can text him all day. I encourage it, even. Tell me if he tries to unsubscribe.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Oh, and don’t worry if you think you're doing bad because Wormtail is pretty shit too.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>If it’s ok with you, I’d like to put you in a group message with Wormtail and Prongs so we can update on where we’re at.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I think that’s all. Look through past messages if you’re unsure but I think it’ll be fine.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I look forward to seeing you on Saturday. I guess we won’t have any problems noticing each other. I mean, I have a broken arm.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I guess I’ll wrap this up now. Have fun on your sexting adventure.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>From Sirius</strong>
</p><p>*</p><p>(10:31) <em>I got your letter.</em></p><p>(10:32) <strong>Oh no</strong></p><p>(10:32) <em>It was lovely.</em></p><p>(10:34) <strong>Lovely?</strong></p><p>(10:34) <em>Yes.</em></p><p>(10:35) <strong>Oh.</strong></p><p>(10:36) <strong>Ok. I’m glad you liked it.</strong></p><p>(10:37)<em> It almost makes up for the messages I’m being bombarded with.</em></p><p>(10:39) <strong>Almost?</strong></p><p>(10:40) <em>Next time write me a poem.</em></p><p>(10:41) <strong>Done.</strong></p><p>(10:41) <em>He ‘misses me’ and ‘wishes I were there with him’.</em></p><p>(10:44) <strong>Yeah, he’s clingy like that.</strong></p><p>(10:44) <em>And he sends this stuff to all the contacts?</em></p><p>(10:47) <strong>Yeah, pretty much.</strong></p><p>(10:48) <em>So not only is he a creep, but he’s an unfaithful creep.</em></p><p>(10:49) <strong>Do you feel betrayed?</strong></p><p>(10:50) <em>I just can’t believe he’d do something like this to me. I thought we would be together forever.</em></p><p>(10:52) <strong>Love dies, Remus.</strong></p><p>(10:52) <em>Oh, that’s depressing.</em></p><p>(10:53) <strong>Sorry. How’s your replying ability?</strong></p><p>(10:53) <em>Awkward, but he doesn’t seem to notice.</em></p><p>(10:55) <strong>Good good.</strong></p><p>(10:55)<em> Oh, and it’s fine, by the way.</em></p><p>(10:55) <strong>Hm?</strong></p><p>(10:57) <em>Group message with Prongs and Wormtail.</em></p><p>(11:00) <strong>Oh, cool. Alright. We’ll do that tonight, then, try and tire Slughorn a little more.</strong></p><p>(11:01) <em>God, if I can, sure.</em></p><p>(11:03) <strong>Thanks Moony. I appreciate this.</strong></p><p>(11:03) <em>Anything for the war effort.</em></p><p>*</p><p>

</p><p>(1:42) <strong>WHAT IF HE DOESN’T TURN UP?</strong></p><p>(1:43) Padfoot</p><p>(1:45) <strong>WHAT IF HE SEES ME BEFORE I SEE HIM AND HE DECIDES TO LEAVE</strong></p><p>(1:45) Don’t be an idiot.</p><p>(1:47) <strong>WHAT IF HE THINKS MY HAIR IS STUPID</strong></p><p>(1:47) I feel like you’re projecting your own fears onto actions he might take.</p><p>(1:49)<strong> As insightful as that was, Prongs, it’s entirely wrong and you should be ashamed.</strong></p><p>(1:50) You should be ashamed! Stop trying to chicken out.</p><p>(1:52) <strong>I’m not chickening out! I’m just worried it’ll all go to shit and it can’t be like it was.</strong></p><p>(1:53) So you’re saying you just wanna text this guy for the rest of your life?</p><p>(1:55) <strong>We can text our vows to each other, I don’t see why it’s a problem.</strong></p><p>(1:56) Meeting him will be good for you.</p><p>(1:59) <strong>Meeting him may potentially ruin me.</strong></p><p>(1:59) Stop being a big baby and drink some cement.</p><p>(2:03) <strong>Wow Prongs you really know how to put a guy at ease.</strong></p><p>(2:04) You’re being irrational. We’ve been over this.</p><p>(2:04) Look, I’ll come with you if you want.</p><p>(2:06) <strong>…Really?</strong></p><p>(2:06) Yes, of course, Padfoot.</p><p>(2:08) <strong>Just as like... a backup. In case something goes wrong.</strong></p><p>(2:09) Yes Sirius.</p><p>(2:09) <strong>Ok.</strong></p><p>(2:10) Ok. Now stop sending me freak out messages.</p><p>(2:11) <strong>Never.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(3:45) <em>I’m going to be in a group message with his friends.</em></p><p>(3:46) <u><strong><em>Is that a problem?</em></strong></u></p><p>(3:46) <em>It’s daunting.

Got this?</strong></p><p>(5:52) <u>Trying to save your own arse at the last minute, huh?</u></p><p>(5:53) <strong>Making sure you don’t make him severely uncomfortable.</strong></p><p>(5:53) We’ll behave, Padfoot. Right, Wormy?</p><p>(5:54) <u>Yeah, yeah.</u></p><p>(5:54) <strong>Ok. I’m adding him now. Really, guys.</strong></p><p>(5:55) Yes, Padfoot, do it!</p><p>
  <em> <strong>[Moony Was Added to the Conversation]</strong> </em>
</p><p>(5:56) <strong>Moony, this is Wormtail, and Prongs you’ve already met.</strong></p><p>(5:56) <em>Uh, hi.</em></p><p>(5:56) <u>Hi.</u></p><p>(5:56) Hey, mate.</p><p>(5:57) <strong>Since I am out of action for this phase, I will be director and call on each of you to present your findings.</strong></p><p>(5:57) <u>Typical.</u></p><p>(5:57) <strong>Wormtail, don’t make me come over there and kick you in the shins. Tell us your findings first.</strong></p><p>(5:58) <u>My findings? He’s a kinky bastard and I think I need therapy!</u></p><p>(5:58) That’s pretty much what I’ve come to find, too.</p><p>(5:59) <strong>Moony?</strong></p><p>(5:59) <em>Yeah, I don’t know how you three can sit in a classroom with him.</em></p><p>(6:00) Trust me, it has become increasingly difficult.</p><p>(6:00) <strong>Any sign of tiring? Boredom? ANYTHING?</strong></p><p>(6:00) <u>Padfoot, I think the plan has backfired.</u></p><p>(6:01) He’s really into it, mate.</p><p>(6:01) <em>I’m making dick puns and he’s still enjoying it.</em></p><p>(6:02) Dick puns?</p><p>(6:02) <em>It’s really not that hard.</em></p><p>(6:02) Hah.</p><p>(6:03) <u>Do you have a Plan B, Padfoot?</u></p><p>(6:03) <strong>I’m thinking. Give me a moment.</strong></p><p>(6:03) This will be a while.</p><p>(6:04) <strong>I can still read your messages, Prongs.</strong></p><p>(6:04) Then you can read about me and Wormtail tell embarrassing stories.</p><p>(6:04) <strong>I SAID THAT WAS FORBIDDEN.</strong></p><p>(6:05) OK OK STOP THROWING THINGS AT ME</p><p>(6:05)<u> I DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING CUT IT OUT</u></p><p>(6:05) <em>Are you all together but still texting each other?</em></p><p>(6:06) We gotta talk to you somehow, mate.</p><p>(6:06) <u>We thought a phone call would get messy.</u></p><p>(6:06) <em>Oh. Ok.</em></p><p>(6:07) <u>Padfoot, any ideas yet?</u></p><p>(6:07) <strong>We need to find a way to make him unsubscribe himself. That’s preferable bc it makes phase four more affective.</strong></p><p>(6:08) <em>So, we need to make him as uncomfortable as we are?</em></p><p>(6:08) Are you suggesting we suggest even more unsavory things?</p><p>(6:09) <em>Yes. We need to weird him out so much he wants us to stop messaging him all together.</em></p><p>(6:09) <strong>Moony, you’re a genius!</strong></p><p>(6:09) <u>Except there’s always the risk that… he’d be into it?</u></p><p>(6:09) <strong>Unless he’s really wrong on the inside, I don’t think he’d be into calling his text babe ‘mummy’.</strong></p><p>(6:10) That’s awful.</p><p>(6:10) <strong>Exactly! The weirder the better. Then he’ll be forced to call it quits.</strong></p><p>(6:11) <strong>Men, are you up to the challenge?</strong></p><p>(6:11) I’ve read Wormtail’s diary, I think I have few things to go on.</p><p>(6:11) <u>Fuck off!

You’re a true soldier, Moony.</strong></p><p>(8:44) <em>How are they doing?</em></p><p>(8:46) <strong>Wormtail is the King of Uncomfortable, and he’s giving Prongs a hand.</strong></p><p>(8:47) <em>Cool. It’s all going swimmingly then.</em></p><p>(8:49) <strong>Yeah, you could say that.</strong></p><p>(8:51) <em>Are we still ok for Saturday?</em></p><p>(8:53) <strong>Yep! Hope you don’t mind arm slings.</strong></p><p>(8:54) <em>Do you have a cast?</em></p><p>(8:56) <strong>No. But you can still write on it if you want.</strong></p><p>(8:56) <em>I’ll have to think of something clever then.</em></p><p>(8:59) <strong>Just don’t do a Wormtail and start calling me by robot names.</strong></p><p>(8:59) <em>Oh, is that what the ‘I, Robot,’ thing was about?</em></p><p>(9:02) <strong>Yeah.

Why are you up?</em></p><p>(8:26) <strong>Prongs was snoring again, so I’ve been awake since four.</strong></p><p>(8:27) <em>Surely you’d just hit him and wake him up?</em></p><p>(8:29) <strong>I have learned through the years that it does nothing. He also hits back in his sleep. He’s a strong guy.</strong></p><p>(8:30) <em>You could always try strangulation. I’ve smothered Alice before. I got a huge lecture on it, but it worked.</em></p><p>(8:32) <strong>You attempted to kill another human being for a night's sleep. That's strong motive. Totally.<br/></strong></p><p>(8:33) <em>I was six! And tired! If it makes you feel better, I’ve never tried it again.</em></p><p>(8:35) <strong>I hope not. That would be manslaughter.</strong></p><p>(8:36) <strong>You are the murderer.</strong></p><p>(8:38) <em>You’ll find out on Saturday, won’t you?</em></p><p>(8:38) <strong>So it’s still happening?</strong></p><p>(8:40) <em>Still happening.

I’ll think and get back to you.</strong></p><p>(8:42) <em>I can live with that.</em></p><p>(8:44) <strong>Cool. Why are you up so early, anyway?</strong></p><p>(8:46) <em>Walking with Alice and then we are … shopping.</em></p><p>(8:47) <strong>Shopping?</strong></p><p>(8:47) <em>For clothes. For me. Send help.</em></p><p>(8:51) <strong>Why on Earth would you submit yourself to that?</strong></p><p>(8:52) <em>You can’t tell Alice no. And I guess it’s also greatly needed.</em></p><p>(8:53) <strong>Surely there’ll be cardigans?</strong></p><p>(8:56) <em>She says jumpers and sweaters I’m afraid.</em></p><p>(8:57) <strong>That will do just as well.</strong></p><p>(8:57) <em>Do you have a thing for knitwear?</em></p><p>(8:58) <strong>And?</strong></p><p>(8:58) <em>Strange, is all.</em></p><p>(8:59) <strong>It’s endearing.</strong></p><p>(9:01) <em>Wool is endearing.</em></p><p>(9:03) <strong>Stop questioning it, Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:04) <em>Sorry, sorry. I’ll leave you and the polyester be.</em></p><p>(9:05) <strong>Feels nice, ok?</strong></p><p>(9:06) <em>Ok C3PO, I believe you.</em></p><p>(9:07) <strong>Wormtail has already used that one.</strong></p><p>(9:09) <em>Looks like I have competition.</em></p><p>(9:09) <em>Ok, Alice says I have to stop texting unless you’re going to provide constructive criticism.</em></p><p>(9:11) <strong>I do have a lot of opinions on knitwear.</strong></p><p>(9:13) <em>Yeah, too many.</em></p><p>(9:15) <strong>I’ll leave you to it.</strong></p><p>(9:16) <em>Please don’t, she wants my opinions on things.</em></p><p>(9:18) <strong>Always pick the second option she provides you. It means the first one was so shit that she had to get something else.</strong></p><p>(9:20) <em>You’re a genius.</em></p><p>(9:23) <strong>Oh, you flatter me.</strong></p><p>(9:24) <em>You’re kinda smart sometimes?</em></p><p>(9:26) <strong>You’re kinda a smartarse sometimes.</strong></p><p>(9:26) <em>Ok I have to physically put things on now.</em></p><p>(9:28) <strong>Do I get to provide opinions on that?</strong></p><p>(9:28) <em>Saturday.</em></p><p>(9:30) <strong>Excellent.

      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p><strong>Sirius is bold</strong><br/><em>Remus is italics</em><br/>James is regular.<br/><u>Peter is underlined</u><br/><strong><em><u>Alice is everything.</u></em></strong></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> chicleeblair brought to my attention the problem with Remus, Alice, and Frank each having cystic fibrosis. Because of the nature of the illness, bacteria can be transported very easily and make the person sick. In the case of cystic fibrosis, if this bacteria is transmitted from one person with CF to another person with CF, it could have fatal consequences. So it is often advised that people with CF do not stay within a few feet of each other to avoid this transmission and, basically, avoid killing each other. Yikes.</p><p>So, from hence forth you should read the story with the assumption that Alice and Frank do not have CF. I have edited previous chapters so that it is not implied that they have CF. Although it is not discussed in the story, Alice has rheumatoid arthritis (whuddup girl, represent) and Frank has Type 1 Diabetes. This means the three could have still met in the hospital.</p><p><strong>ALSO:</strong> A friend just pointed out and I forgot to mention - in this story Sirius and Tonks are not related. Why does everyone have to be related to everyone???? It's so messy. Too many connections that just become entangled. So yeah, if anyone was wondering!!</p></blockquote>

Ok, ok. Calming down.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Tell me what happened. Now.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Alright, so, even better than planned he decided that we would have an impromptu test. So the whole classroom was silent while his phone buzzed like crazy and by this point a few other students have asked him to turn it off and Slughorn, being the wanker he is, just told them to mind their own business and ignore it.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>How incompetent.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Right? Anyway, after the ten minute mark I said 'Sir, I seem to recall that when it was my phone going off, my messages were read out to the class'.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Oh, so you were subtle about it, then?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Subtle enough. Prongs and Wormtail got into badgering him to read the messages. Then Redhind told him 'Sir, those are you own rules. You have to follow your own rules.'

My story still isn't finished.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Very well, carry on.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>While the class hounded him I took it upon myself to grab his phone and start reading out his messages.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Oh my god, Padfoot!</em>"</p><p>"<strong>It was interesting, to say the least. Some very imaginative people on the internet.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Are you going to prison? Are you using your one phone call right now?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>No, Moony, I am nicely tucked away in my dorm room right now.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>What messages did you read out, then?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Let's see… Some of them were hilarious. My favourite included 'I want to kiss your awesome neck, then your awesome shoulders, and then kiss your nice boob, and then maybe your other nice boob, and maybe if I'm up for it your pudgy belly'.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>What?!</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I know, it was incredible. Some of them were actually quite… raunchy, too, which was brilliant. One said: 'I'm sitting at my desk fantasizing about how hot it would be to do it in my office.' Except I pretended that was a message Slughorn wrote.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Oh my god, Sirius!</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I know.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>And you read those out?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Yep. The class collectively told him that it must be done, fair is fair. He went so red, Remus, it was the single most glorious moment of my life. And the best bit?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Mm?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>He'll try to blame me, but he won't be able to report it, because that would mean telling Dumbledore he read out my private messages, and he has no definitive proof it was me. And he never will.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>You're the devil.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I'm just well prepared.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>So besides going red, how did he handle it?</em>"</p><p>"<strong>He was nearly crying, but if I'm going to be honest with you Remus, I nearly was when he did it to me too. So there's that. He snatched the phone from me and threw it out the window and tried to tell us he'd contracted a virus on it. That's when Wormtail helpfully pointed out that you only get a virus if you visit one of those sites or services in the first place.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>You're… incredible.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I know. Refrain yourself, Moony, I know. He was so mortified.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>You sound so gleeful.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>I am.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>…Me too. He's a bastard.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>That's it, Moony! Good to hear it! Ok, I have to go, but I read out many more messages.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Do tell me about them.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>Will do. See you at five?</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Yeah. 'See me' more or less.</em>"</p><p>"<strong>You know what I mean.</strong>"</p><p>"<em>Yes. See you, Padfoot.

You’re so high maintenance.</strong></p><p>(12:52) <u>Not as easy as you thought I was.</u></p><p>(12:53) <strong>I need you to put up the balloons I’ve put in the fifth shower stall on our floor.</strong></p><p>(12:55) <u>What’s in them?</u></p><p>(12:56) <strong>Nothing deadly this time, you can touch them.</strong></p><p>(12:57) <strong>Oh, and give up your fartbombs.</strong></p><p>(12:58) <u>I’m giving a lot to this Mission with little return.</u></p><p>(12:59) <strong>I’ll do your English History too.</strong></p><p>(12:59) <u>You don’t even take English History!!</u></p><p>(1:00) <strong>So?

What’s the game?</em></p><p>(2:58) <strong>Would You Rather.</strong></p><p>(2:59) <em>I hate these. I always want to pick neither, but apparently that’s not allowed.</em></p><p>(3:00) <strong>No, it is not, and I will not tolerate it. You’re also not allowed to pick ‘both’ or alter any answer. Straight up, option 1 or 2.</strong></p><p>(3:00) <em>I’m going to regret this.</em></p><p>(3:01) <strong>Easy one: Team Edward or Team Jacob.</strong></p><p>(3:02) <em>What the – how is that easy??</em></p><p>(3:02) <strong>Come on, everyone knows their answer already.</strong></p><p>(3:03)<em> Immediate death?</em></p><p>(3:03) <strong>Did you read the series? You’d go Jacob, at least until the last book.</strong></p><p>(3:03) <strong>Plus, Jacob Black, you can’t deny our connection.</strong></p><p>(3:04) <em>So I’m meant to pick him because you both have the same surname?</em></p><p>(3:04) <strong>Duh, Moony.</strong></p><p>(3:04) <em>You’re incredible. My turn.</em></p><p>(3:05) <em>Flying or invisibility?</em></p><p>(3:05) <strong>Flying. Shit, no invisibility. Could get away with so many pranks with that.</strong></p><p>(3:05) <strong>But flying would be so cooooooool.</strong></p><p>(3:06) <strong>Nope. Invisibility. There. Ok.</strong></p><p>(3:06) <em>Flying would be terrifying.</em></p><p>(3:07) <strong>A flying motorbike would be cool.</strong></p><p>(3:07) <em>Only you would think of that. Go on.</em></p><p>(3:09) <strong>Eat healthy or exercise regularly?</strong></p><p>(3:10) <em>You’re evil. Pure and utter evil.</em></p><p>(3:10) <strong>Is it really that hard?</strong></p><p>(3:11)<em> I don't like vegetables.</em></p><p>(3:12) <strong>You get to pick what the healthy foods are.</strong></p><p>(3:12) <em>Healthy food then.</em></p><p>(3:13) <em>Would you rather go on the Amazing Race or Survivor?</em></p><p>(3:14) <strong>Oo, Amazing Race. That would be wicked! Travelling around the world, eating terrible shit and jumping off stuff. Good fun.</strong></p><p>(3:14) <em>Sifting through foreign animal feces…</em></p><p>(3:15) <strong>Good times to be had. Be a vampire or a werewolf?</strong></p><p>(3:16) <em>That’s tricky. Neither look like fun.</em></p><p>(3:17) <strong>Vampire is a twenty-four hour thing, though.</strong></p><p>(3:17)<em> But it can be controlled, to a degree. Werewolves just go vicious without control.</em></p><p>(3:18) <strong>Can’t eat garlic bread if you’re a vampire.</strong></p><p>(3:18) <em>Guess as a werewolf I can be kept in a cage for a night…</em></p><p>(3:19) <em>Werewolf. Begrudgingly.</em></p><p>(3:19) <strong>They’re so much more cooler, anyway.</strong></p><p>(3:20) <em>If you say so.</em></p><p>(3:21) <em>Ok then: brains or brawn?</em></p><p>(3:21) <strong>Clearly, Moony, I like my men with a bit of muscle.</strong></p><p>(3:22) <em>Ha-ha. I meant for you. Would you rather be smart or strong?</em></p><p>(3:22) <strong>Oh. Smart seems to be working for me.</strong></p><p>(3:23) <em>This is you being smart?</em></p><p>(3:23) <strong>And this is you being a smart arse.</strong></p><p>(3:23) <em>I would choose brawn so I could punch the smugness off your face.</em></p><p>(3:24) <strong>You’re a very violent man when provoked.</strong></p><p>(3:24) <em>Just ask your question now.</em></p><p>(3:26) <strong>Ok. Would you rather your first time be in a car or a bed?</strong></p><p>(3:26) <em>I’ve been waiting for this kind of question.</em></p><p>(3:26) <strong>Moony, we both knew where this game was going.</strong></p><p>(3:28) <em>Car sounds very… Claustrophobic.</em></p><p>(3:28) <em>Do you even have a car?</em></p><p>(3:29) <strong>Are you saying your first time will be with me?</strong></p><p>(3:30) <em>…Shit.</em></p><p>(3:30) <strong>AW MOONY</strong></p><p>(3:31) <em>Be quiet</em></p><p>(3:31) <strong>This is the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.</strong></p><p>(3:31) <em>I can’t believe this. Why does this keep happening to me.</em></p><p>(3:32) <strong>Don’t fret, Moony.</strong></p><p>(3:33)<strong> I’m not a big fan of the car idea myself.</strong></p><p>(3:34) <em>Ok then.</em></p><p>(3:34) <em>Would you rather us take it slowly or desperate and hungry, while we are in this bed.</em></p><p>(3:34) <strong>Woah shit</strong></p><p>(3:35) <strong>Um</strong></p><p>(3:36) <strong>Hmmmmmm… Slowly. I’d take my time to learn every inch of you.</strong></p><p>(3:36) <strong>Make it last longer.</strong></p><p>(3:37) <em>I feel like we’ve waited long enough.</em></p><p>(3:38) <strong>Then a little more won’t kill you.</strong></p><p>(3:38) <em>It could. You never know.</em></p><p>(3:39) <strong>Sounds like somebody wanted me to pick the ‘desperate and hungry’ option.</strong></p><p>(3:40) <em>I don’t mind, just as long as it happens soon.</em></p><p>(3:41)<em> I have to get going, it’s my turn to help make dinner. Imagine fifteen teenagers with varying degrees of physical abilities trying to make a meal for fifty people.</em></p><p>(3:42) <strong>I’m imagining a lot of swearing and maybe some violence.</strong></p><p>(3:42) <em>Also a few close calls with boiled water. Possibly not accidental.</em></p><p>(3:43) <strong>Good luck. I hope you don’t get boiled.</strong></p><p>(3:44) <em>I’m not getting boiled.</em></p><p>(3:44)<em> I’m doing the boiling.</em></p><p>*</p><p>

  <em>Dearest Padfoot,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It is currently Wednesday afternoon while I write this. I hope it’s ok that I’m writing this. There was a return address on the letter you sent me, and even though it was just the school, I hope by putting your name on it that it reaches you. If not, the stranger who is reading mail not address to them, what the fuck is wrong with you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope Sheba is behaving. No, I hope you’re behaving, and that you’re not getting my goldfish entangled with your shenanigans. They are an innocent bystander to whatever rubbish you’re concocting over there. I hope I get my goldfish back in one piece.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My parents come home next Sunday, and I get back the next day. They’ll be home in the evening, though, so if you could bring Sheba back on Sunday morning? If Molly isn’t there, there’s a spare key taped to the wind chime at the front door. Yes, the one with all the stars and planets circling the sun. My parents were new wave philosophers, or something. But I guess so were yours, Dog Star.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wales is cold and miserable and I’m willing to bet that wherever you are it is not. This is very unfair.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I probably don’t give this impression a lot, but I want to be wherever you are. Even if it were in Wales where it’s cold and miserable. I’d follow you wherever you go.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That’s probably not healthy, but I’m trying not to dwell on it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, I am aware my handwriting is very feminine. Alice says she could probably use it as a Microsoft font. You’re not allowed to agree.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You’ve just defeated the terrible Slughorn in the fortnight-long battle. I whine at you to be responsible but really he deserved much worse. I'm proud, Padfoot.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m having too many thoughts and no thoughts at all currently, so I guess I’ll conclude this letter. I had a spare afternoon and… well, I liked the letter you sent me. I may or may not keep it in my jean pocket. But I would never admit that. That would be sappy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em><strike>I lo</strike> Talk to you later, Sirius. Or probably in five minutes. This is strange.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>From Moony</em>
</p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Monday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:31) <strong>I got your letter.</strong></p><p>(9:32) <em>Oh dear, I’d forgotten about that.</em></p><p>(9:32) <strong>Sheba is doing fine, by the way. Wormtail is quite taken with them.</strong></p><p>(9:32) <em>I’m glad Wormtail has finally made a nice friend.</em></p><p>(9:33) <strong>Prongs and I are totally nice!</strong></p><p>(9:33) <strong>Ok, small lie.</strong></p><p>(9:33) <em>Big white lie. How’s your shoulder?</em></p><p>(9:34) <strong>No, no, we have to dissect your letter further.</strong></p><p>(9:34) <em>No, come on, Padfoot!</em></p><p>(9:35) <strong>Did you honestly know that already or did you google my name?</strong></p><p>(9:35) <em>What?</em></p><p>(9:36) <strong>Dog Star.</strong></p><p>(9:36) <em>Oh! Tonks told me. She’s really into astrology.</em></p><p>(9:37) <strong>And the handwriting…</strong></p><p>(9:37) <em>No, really, how is your shoulder blade?</em></p><p>(9:38) <strong>I’m surprised you didn't dot your I’s with hearts.</strong></p><p>(9:38) <em>I’m sure it must be really sore.</em></p><p>(9:39) <strong>Alice is right, you could use this as a font.</strong></p><p>(9:40) <em>Maybe I’ll ask Prongs to give you extra hard pats on the back.</em></p><p>(9:41) <strong>This isn’t fair, I can’t conspire with Alice!</strong></p><p>(9:41) <em>Which I am eternally grateful for. That force would be terrifying.</em></p><p>(9:41) <strong>I don’t know if I agree with her affiliations though.</strong></p><p>(9:42) <em>Frank is better, I swear. He stopped being weird after Alice found out. And well, when you happened too.</em></p><p>(9:42) <strong>Bc he knows I’ll beat his arse?</strong></p><p>(9:42) <em>That’s gay.</em></p><p>(9:43) <strong>BC HE KNOWS I’LL PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE?</strong></p><p>(9:43) <em>I… yes. I might have mentioned it to him.</em></p><p>(9:44) <strong>Woah, really?</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>Well this is embarrassing now.</em></p><p>(9:45) <strong>MOONY WHAT DID YOU SAY OH MY GOD</strong></p><p>(9:46) <em>I might have said that if he lies to Alice again, especially about me, then…</em></p><p>(9:47)<strong> Go on.</strong></p><p>(9:48) <em>No, I can't do it.</em></p><p>(9:49) <strong>Moony!</strong></p><p>(9:50) <em>You have to promise it won’t be weird.</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>My God, Moony, what did you say?</strong></p><p>(9:51) <em>I… Might have said that my boyfriend would gladly punch him in the face.</em></p><p>(9:52) <strong>IS THAT ME</strong></p><p>(9:52) <em>It sounded more intimidating than “my friend who I text all the time will punch you in the face.” But yes, that’s you.</em></p><p>(9:53) <strong>Oh my god</strong></p><p>(9:53) <em>I hope I haven’t made it weird now.</em></p><p>(9:54) <strong>Of course not, Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:54) <em>It’s just we said we wouldn’t go there until we met and I broke that rule.</em></p><p>(9:54) <strong>I really, honestly don’t mind.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>I’m sorry!</em></p><p>(9:55) <strong>Moony! Stop! I. Actually quite like it.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>Oh.</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>Did it work?</strong></p><p>(9:57) <em>Pardon?</em></p><p>(9:58) <strong>Did it intimidate Frank?</strong></p><p>(9:58) <em>Oh, yes. Alice also filled in that you had a motorbike and was probably in a gang.</em></p><p>(9:59) <strong>That last one isn’t quite true.</strong></p><p>(9:59) <em>Are you sure?</em></p><p>(10:00) <strong>We’re not a gang! We’re… a group! We’re a group of friends.</strong></p><p>(10:00) <em>Ok sure.</em></p><p>(10:00) <strong>A group of friends who happen to have a collective name.</strong></p><p>(10:01) <em>I’m sorry, what?</em></p><p>(10:02) <strong>Haven’t I mentioned this?</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>Mentioned what?</em></p><p>(10:03) <strong>In our first year, Wormy, Prongs and I decided that we needed to leave a mark on the school. So we had to have a name for ourselves.</strong></p><p>(10:04) <em>You’re… I was always joking when I asked if you were in a gang. Never did I even consider the possible truth.</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>It’s not a gang!! Come on, Moony. We didn’t make you go through any weird initiations now did we?</strong></p><p>(10:06) <em>What? Why would you?</em></p><p>(10:07) <strong>You’re one of us, Remus, come on.</strong></p><p>(10:08) <em>I’m… What, exactly?</em></p><p>(10:09) <strong>You’re a Marauder.</strong></p><p>(10:15)<strong> Remus?</strong></p><p>(10:16) <em>I’m taking a moment.</em></p><p>(10:16) <strong>What’s wrong?</strong></p><p>(10:17) <em>This sounds like a thing you have with your friends.</em></p><p>(10:17) <strong>Are you not my friend?</strong></p><p>(10:18) <em>But, I mean. Wormtail and Prongs are your friends and that’s your friendship group…</em></p><p>(10:18) <strong>And now you’re in that friendship group too.</strong></p><p>(10:19) <em>Don’t Prongs and Wormtail mind?</em></p><p>(10:19) <strong>Of course not! Don’t be ridiculous, Moony. Prongs adores you! And Wormtail is quite taken with your fish. They like you.</strong></p><p>(10:20) <strong>I like you.</strong></p><p>(10:20) <strong>Please say you’ll be in our totally-not-a-gang gang?</strong></p><p>(10:21) <em>Padfoot, I would love to be in your totally-not-a-gang gang.</em></p><p>(10:21) <strong>It makes me all warm and fuzzy on the inside to hear you say that, Moony.</strong></p><p>(10:22)<em> It makes me all warm and fuzzy on the inside to be in your gang, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(10:23) <strong>It’s not a gang.</strong></p><p>(10:23) <em>It is a gang. And you are now launching a gang war with the new mystery pranksters.</em></p><p>(10:24) <strong>I have a list of possible suspects but Prongs doesn’t want to hear about it. He’s high strung on the match this weekend.</strong></p><p>(10:25) <em>Important?</em></p><p>(10:25) <strong>It decides who will be in the final against Slytherin. After the final are the interschool matches.</strong></p><p>(10:26) <em>Are you playing this week?</em></p><p>(10:26) <strong>You bet, Moony!</strong></p><p>(10:27) <em>Padfoot!!</em></p><p>(10:28)<strong> What?</strong></p><p>(10:29) <em>Your arm!</em></p><p>(10:30) <strong>You worry toooo much. I’ll be fine.</strong></p><p>(10:31) <em>No, Prongs will have to call me to tell me you’re in hospital. Again.</em></p><p>(10:32) <strong>It happens one time so now it’s a thing?</strong></p><p>(10:33) <em>Yes.</em></p><p>(10:33) <strong>I promise I will be careful.</strong></p><p>(10:34) <em>Better.</em></p><p>(10:34) <em>I must partake in the compulsory team building exercises now.</em></p><p>(10:35) <strong>Go team.</strong></p><p>(10:36) <em>They’ve been building a hut out of sticks for half an hour now and the camp runners have only just realized I’m not helping.</em></p><p>(10:37) <strong>And why aren’t you helping, Moony?</strong></p><p>(10:37) <em>Tonks has got a good hold on it. I also don't want her to yell at me.</em></p><p>(10:38) <em>OK SHE’S YELLING AT ME ANYWAY. I’ll talk to you later, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(10:39) <strong>Cya, Moony.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Monday PM</u>
</p><p>(5:23) <em>I miss our phone calls.</em></p><p>(5:24) <strong>Me too. I was half way through my detention when I realized I didn't have that to look forward to.</strong></p><p>(5:25)<em> I miss you.</em></p><p>(5:26) <strong>I miss you too, Moony. You’ll be home soon.</strong></p><p>(5:27) <em>Not soon enough.</em></p><p>(5:28) <strong>Next Monday, right?</strong></p><p>(5:29) <em>Yes.</em></p><p>(5:29) <strong>Six more days.</strong></p><p>(5:30) <em>Six more days.</em></p><p>(5:31) <em>I haven’t wanted to mention it before, but…</em></p><p>(5:32) <em>I mean, considering what happened last time, I didn’t think I should</em></p><p>(5:33) <em>I. Fuck. I can’t think of the words.</em></p><p>(5:34) <strong>I want to see you, Moony.</strong></p><p>(5:34) <em>I want to see you too. Preferably as soon as possible.</em></p><p>(5:35) <strong>Six more days. And then we’ll see when we can fit it in.</strong></p><p>(5:37) <em>Ok. We can do that. That’s good.</em></p><p>(5:38) <strong>I miss you.</strong></p><p>(5:38) <em>I miss you too.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(9:56) <em>Good night, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(9:57) <strong>Good night, Moony.</strong></p><p>*</p><p><a name="OLE_LINK10" id="OLE_LINK10"></a> <a name="OLE_LINK9" id="OLE_LINK9"></a> <u>Tuesday AM</u></p><p>(10:01) <em>You never did tell me how your shoulder is.</em></p><p>(10:02) <strong>It’s swollen.

Maybe you can make me one out of sticks.</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>Har.</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>My parents have written to me about the whole bill thing, though.</strong></p><p>(10:05) <em>Written to you? Do they not have your number?</em></p><p>(10:07) <strong>The whole reason why I got a new phone was so they couldn’t contact me.</strong></p><p>(10:07) <em>Oh.</em></p><p>(10:08) <strong>Yeah. The Potter’s got it for me as a belated Christmas present.</strong></p><p>(10:09) <strong>So I guess you could thank shitty parenting for us meeting.</strong></p><p>(10:10) <em>I think I’m going to thank the Potters. Or your clumsy fingers.</em></p><p>(10:10) <em>I’m not going to thank them for anything. Besides your birth, I guess.</em></p><p>(10:11) <strong>Birthing me was the best thing they ever did, indeed.</strong></p><p>(10:11) <em>So what did they say about the bill?</em></p><p>(10:12) <strong>They said I will be paying them back, but I’m going to ignore it. They can’t prove it was me. I can’t be tattooed. I’m underage, after all.</strong></p><p>(10:12) <em>Ah, the tricky technicality.</em></p><p>(10:13) <strong>I’m surprised you’re not chastising me for dishonesty.</strong></p><p>(10:13) <em>I feel like it’s the least they owe you.</em></p><p>(10:14) <em>You know how you said that uh..

It would make a nice border for your page dedication.</em></p><p>(2:52) <em>Tonks volunteered me to help organize a party.

They’re also fucking pricks. His brother kinda included.</p><p>(3:29) <em>What happened?</em></p><p>(3:30) Words were said in the Great Hall and now we can’t find him. He’s not in his usual spots but his motorbike is still here.</p><p>(3:31) <em>So he can’t be far.</em></p><p>(3:32) No, not far at all. But he won’t answer us.</p><p>(3:33) <em>And you think he’d answer me? He’s already been a bit short about it with me.</em></p><p>(3:34) You talked him down from Slughorn’s car that time.

Anyway, um, I didn’t actually expect to get this far so I don’t really know what to say. Actually, that’s a lie. I’ve recited in my head what I want to say to you.

No, I do actually, but I don't understand why you would believe it, especially from them. I don’t believe it for a second, and I’m sure Prongs and Wormtail don’t either. You shouldn’t. There’s nothing about you that I’ve encountered that would ever fall under the label of ‘disgraced’ or ‘fuck up.’ You’re incredibly smart and loyal.

  <u>Thursday PM</u>
</p><p>(1:12) <em>I can't entirely tell if your advice was good or not.</em></p><p>(1:13) <strong><u><em>Hello, Remus.</em></u></strong></p><p>(1:13) <strong><em><u>What advice? I give you a lot of advice. For a smart boy you're awfully clueless.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:14) <em>I didn't push the topic and it kind of… escalated.</em></p><p>(1:15) <u><em><strong>Is he alright?</strong></em></u></p><p>(1:16) <em>Yes. I mean, he is now, I think.</em></p><p>(1:18) <strong><em><u>I'm sorry.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:19) <em>It's not your fault. How's home?</em></p><p>(1:20) <strong><u><em>Boooooring. You're coming home soon, right?</em></u></strong></p><p>(1:20) <em>Monday. Not long.</em></p><p>(1:21) <u><em><strong>We are having a movie marathon once you get back.</strong></em></u></p><p>(1:21) <em>So long as it's not a running marathon.</em></p><p>(1:22) <strong><em><u>I would never do that to you, Remus.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:24) <em>Oh really? Is that true?</em></p><p>(1:24) <em>I guess 2010 must have been a blur for you, then.</em></p><p>(1:24) <strong><em><u>That was one time.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:26) <em>The marathon ran for four days, Alice, I'm counting that as more than once.</em></p><p>(1:27) <strong><em><u>You're so sensitive, Remus, I didn't even make you run.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:27) <em>No, you took off without me! I had to make friends with Mrs Figs With Osteoporosis.</em> </p><p>(1:29) <u><strong><em>Oh, but she was lovely! I remember those chocolate truffles she brought on the third day.</em></strong></u></p><p>(1:30) <em>Do you also remember her several cats and their ranging personalities? I could tell you now, since you missed out last time.</em></p><p>(1:31) <strong><em><u>I'm good, thank you Remus.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:32) <em>Are you sure? There's Floozle, who doesn't like it when she vacuums so she does it as little as possible.</em></p><p>(1:33) <strong><em><u>Really, I'm fine. </u></em></strong></p><p>(1:34) <em>Oh, if you want it straight from Mrs Figs herself I think I still have her phone number somewhere.</em></p><p>(1:36) <u><strong><em>Don't do this, Remus, you're better than this.</em></strong></u></p><p>(1:37) <em>Make sure you rent out Love, Actually.</em></p><p>(1:38) <strong><em><u>I'm not an idiot.</u></em></strong></p><p>(1:39) <em>Making sure.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(3:12) <strong>I’ve narrowed the list down.</strong></p><p>(3:13) <em>What list?</em></p><p>(3:13) <strong>The potential counter-pranksters!</strong></p><p>(3:15) <em>Counter-pranksters?</em></p><p>(3:16) <strong>Well, we are the pranksters. Any others are defying our rule.</strong></p><p>(3:18) <em>This isn’t a revolution.</em></p><p>(3:18) <strong>But it is!</strong></p><p>(3:19) <strong>No! Wait! It’s war!</strong></p><p>(3:20) <em>I thought you were going to take them under your wing?</em></p><p>(3:21) <strong>That was until they painted Dumbledore’s car pink! Granted, Dumbledore was quite happy with it, but still. No one saw them do it!</strong></p><p>(3:22)<em> That’s not pranking, that’s vandalism.</em></p><p>(3:22) <strong>It actually looks quite good. But that’s beside the point.</strong></p><p>(3:23) <em>What’s the list then, Padfoot?</em></p><p>(3:25) <strong>They have to be Gryffindors.</strong></p><p>(3:25) <strong>Lions, that is. One of us.</strong></p><p>(3:26) <em>Why do you say that?</em></p><p>(3:28) <strong>Bc Slytherin pranks involve serious injury, Ravenclaws don't prank when they can drown you in sarcasm instead, and Hufflepuff pranks involve mixing your Coke with cordial when you leave it unattended.</strong></p><p>(3:30) <em>Are you… stereotyping entire houses at your school?</em></p><p>(3:30) <strong>Yes. So?</strong></p><p>(3:31) <em>You’re never going to find them like that.</em></p><p>(3:31) <strong>What do you mean?????</strong></p><p>(3:33) <em>They expect you to go by the stereotypes, and thus disguising themselves better. You have to keep an open mind.</em></p><p>(3:34) <strong>Mooooooony.</strong></p><p>(3:35) <em>What?</em></p><p>(3:36) <strong>You ruined my only lead.</strong></p><p>(3:37) <em>Sorry, Padfoot. As they say, back to the drawing board?</em></p><p>(3:37) <strong>This is much harder than finding out what illness you have.</strong></p><p>(3:39) <em>That’s because I left clues. What clues have they left?</em></p><p>(3:40) <strong>They left a spray can by Dumbledork’s car. Moony, you’re a genius!</strong></p><p>(3:41) <em>Ok, now I’m confused.</em></p><p>(3:42) <strong>I can lift their fingerprints from the spray can.</strong></p><p>(3:43) <em>…Can you honestly?</em></p><p>(3:44) <strong>No, Moony, come on. They’re invisible!</strong></p><p>(3:44) <strong>Wait.</strong></p><p>(3:46) <em>What now?</em></p><p>(3:46) <strong>I could do a stake out. Try and catch them in the act.</strong></p><p>(3:47) <em>How? How will you know where they’ll strike next?</em></p><p>(3:48) <strong>I know where I’d strike next, if Prongs and Wormtail weren’t being wet blankets.</strong></p><p>(3:48) <em>Where, then?</em></p><p>(3:50) <strong>Slytherin courtyard just got a new statue for their namesake. I’d… Do something to it.</strong></p><p>(3:51) <em>And then if nothing happens to it, you know it’s a Slytherin.</em></p><p>(3:51) <strong>Brilliant, Moony!!</strong></p><p>(3:52) <em>So… you’re going to stake out a statue when and how long?</em></p><p>(3:53) <strong>Well I’m doing nothing tonight. Are you?</strong></p><p>(3:53) <em>Yeah, I thought I’d go see the ballet.</em></p><p>(3:54)<strong> Excellent, so you’re free. We’re going on a stake out, Moony.</strong></p><p>(3:55) <em>Siriussssss. For how long?</em></p><p>(3:55) <strong>For as long as we have to!</strong></p><p>(3:56)<em> !! No!</em></p><p>(3:56) <strong>Ok, fine. Until… one am. Personally, I’d do it at midnight. Give them some leeway time. Acceptable?</strong></p><p>(3:57) <em>I suppose. In that case, I’m going to nap now.</em></p><p>(3:57) <strong>Aw, fragile Moony.</strong></p><p>(3:58) <em>More like wants-to-conserve-his-spoons-Moony.</em></p><p>(3:59) <strong>What? Why are you hoarding spoons?</strong></p><p>(3:59) <em>Never mind. I’ll explain later. Now I’m sleeping.</em></p><p>(4:00) <strong>Good night, Moony.</strong></p><p>(4:00) <em>Good night, Padfoot.</em></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Friday AM</u>
</p><p>(12:15) <strong>Here we go. You’re awake, right?</strong></p><p>(12:17) <em>Right. How could I sleep with all this adventure going on?</em></p><p>(12:18) <strong>Wow. Bad nap?</strong></p><p>(12:19) <em>Perfect nap. I’d like another one.</em></p><p>(12:20) <strong>Come on, we’ll be here an hour, max.</strong></p><p>(12:22) <em>Very well. What’s the statue look like?</em></p><p>(12:24) <strong>Snobbish looking bloke with a snake coiled around his feet. He’s also got a sword, brandishing it above his head. Very heroic.</strong></p><p>(12:25) <em>Who’s he meant to be?</em></p><p>(12:26) <strong>Salazar Slytherin. Yeah, he sounds like an evil Count or something.</strong></p><p>(12:27) <em>Is he killing the snake? That would count as heroic and very not-villiany.</em></p><p>(12:30) <strong>HA, no, that’s his family emblem. Right, so basically, a bunch of old timey people built a school and made themselves into these heroic figures so the students could worship them. Some very dodgy stories though, and Prongs may have accidentally disproved Rowena Ravenclaw’s story of fame in second year. Their head of house wasn’t happy.</strong></p><p>(12:31) <em>At least they made your school fancy.</em></p><p>(12:33) <strong>Nothing says prestige quite like having the biggest tree in the school being constantly teepee’d.</strong></p><p>(12:34) <em>I imagine that’s mostly your fault, though.</em></p><p>(12:35) <strong>Nah, that’s Wormtail’s department. He’s in charge of keeping the Whomping Willow toilet papered at all times.</strong></p><p>(12:36)<em> You named the tree Whomping Willow?</em></p><p>(12:37) <strong>One winter a branch broke off and tore through McG’s car. That was a bad week. She was all crabby.</strong></p><p>(12:37) <em>Gee, I wonder why. Any signs of counter-pranksters?</em></p><p>(12:38) <strong>None thus far. I have a clown costume in case they don’t show, though.</strong></p><p>(12:39) <em>What are you going to do with a clown costume?</em></p><p>(12:39) <strong>Dress up Sally a bit.</strong></p><p>(12:40) <em>That’s not the aim of the stake out! If it’s not tonight, it could be tomorrow. You’d be ruining your chances!</em></p><p>(12:41) <strong>Moooony. Stop killing my vibe.</strong></p><p>(12:42) <em>I can’t believe your lack of dedication to the cause. You’re disappointing me.</em></p><p>(12:43) <strong>Fiiiiine. We’ll wait.</strong></p><p>(12:44) <strong>Tell me what the spoon thing was.</strong></p><p>(12:45) <em>Oh right</em></p><p>(12:45) <em>Well, it’s this analogy that sort of explains what it’s like to live with a chronic illness (or disability) where, uh, spoons are used as measureable devices to represent energy. I naturally have limited energy because of my illness, so small activities can mean I lose energy, or ‘spoons’. Some days it varies how many spoons I have to begin with and how many spoons I lose. It’s hard to predict.</em></p><p>(12:47) <strong>Being up at midnight can lose you spoons?</strong></p><p>(12:47) <em>Yes. Sleep is important for conserving energy for everyone, anyway. Thus, why I took a nap.</em></p><p>(12:48) <strong>Serious question now, Moony.</strong></p><p>(12:49) <em>It must be if you’re using “serious.”</em></p><p>(12:50) <strong>Exactly.</strong></p><p>(12:50) <strong>Why spoons?</strong></p><p>(12:52) <em>HAHA</em></p><p>(12:52) <strong>Moony, don’t be mean.</strong></p><p>(12:53) <em>I’m sorry, there’s just… There’s no real reason why spoons.</em></p><p>(12:54) <em>In the original story two friends (one healthy, and one chronically ill) are at a diner. Healthy Friend asks Chronically Ill Friend why they don’t go out together more often, and CIF explains how their illness doesn’t really let them, but HF doesn’t understand. The closest thing CIF had to explain what they meant in a physical demonstration were spoons. Holding the spoons up to HF, CIF explains that they have only a certain number of spoons for the day, while HF has an unlimited supply. Each activity takes a spoon or so away from their capabilities.</em></p><p>(12:55) <strong>So you could have very easily been measuring your energy levels with sugar packets.</strong></p><p>(12:55) <em>Yes, it was a close call. It would have been handy for Frank, though.</em></p><p>(12:55) <em>“I can’t go out today, my sugars are low.”</em></p><p>(12:56) <strong>I don't get it.</strong></p><p>(12:56) <em>Frank has Type 1 Diabetes.</em></p><p>(12:56)<strong> OH</strong></p><p>(12:57) <strong>HAHA</strong></p><p>(12:57) <strong>That would have been excellent.</strong></p><p>(12:58) <strong>But I’m sorry for losing you spoons, Moony.</strong></p><p>(12:58) <em>My spoons are doing fine, Padfoot. If I couldn't do it I’d tell you.</em></p><p>(12:58) <strong>Ok. Yeah. Do that.</strong></p><p>(12:59) <em>Anything happening there yet?</em></p><p>(1:00) <strong>No, I’m about to call it quits. It’s cold out here.</strong></p><p>(1:00) <em>I’m still ok if you want to wait longer.</em></p><p>(1:01) <strong>Ok, we’ll see how far we can go. I’m still cold though.</strong></p><p>(1:02) <em>Think hot thoughts.</em></p><p>(1:02) <strong>Hot thoughts, you say?</strong></p><p>(1:02) <em>Warm. Warm thoughts is what I meant. Think about something warm.</em></p><p>(1:03) <strong>Really? I think I’d prefer to think hot thoughts.</strong></p><p>(1:03) <em>Keep them to yourself.</em></p><p>(1:04) <strong>I’m sure it must be cold in Wales. Don't want me to share my hot thoughts?</strong></p><p>(1:04) <em>I have a comforter, I’m good.</em></p><p>(1:05) <strong>In one of my hot thoughts I’m in the comforter with you.</strong></p><p>(1:05) <em>Ergh, you’re unbearable.</em></p><p>(1:06) <strong>And you never yield, Mooncrest.</strong></p><p>(1:06) <em>You know the phrase “actions speak louder than words”?</em></p><p>(1:08) <strong>Oo, is that a promise?</strong></p><p>(1:09) <em>Will it force you to stop making implications?</em></p><p>(1:09) <strong>I’m hurt you don’t like my implications.</strong></p><p>(1:10) <em>I feel weird about being receptive to your implications while there are half a dozen people in the room.</em></p><p>(1:10) <strong>Aren’t they sleeping?</strong></p><p>(1:11) <em>Yes, but they are also snoring. I am very aware that they are there.</em></p><p>(1:12) <strong>You’re a strange boy, Remus Lupin.</strong></p><p>(1:13) <em>You’re not exactly regular yourself, you know.</em></p><p>(1:14) <em>I’m starting to feel like this stake out is a bust.</em></p><p>(1:20) <em>Padfoot?</em></p><p>(1:28) <em>Please tell me you’ve fallen asleep and not that the counter-pranksters have captured you.</em></p><p>(1:29) <em>If this is the counter-pranksters, I’m Remus. I’m afraid I don’t have the ransom needed to pay for Sirius. He’s all yours.</em></p><p>(1:33) <em>Ok, you must be asleep. You wouldn't stand for that kind of insult if you were awake.</em></p><p>(1:33) <em>Good night, Padfoot.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(8:01) <strong>I had a first year poke me with a stick to see if I was alive.</strong></p><p>(8:04) <em>I understand the feeling</em></p><p>(8:04) <em>You’re like the most annoying first year with the biggest stick right now.</em></p><p>(8:05) <strong>Sorry Moony if I’m not that sympathetic</strong></p><p>(8:06) <strong>For you see</strong></p><p>(8:06)<strong> I woke up in a fucking garden.</strong></p><p>(8:07) <em>You’re fault.</em></p><p>(8:08) <strong>There’s even worse news, Moony.</strong></p><p>(8:09) <em>Your hair is a mess?</em></p><p>(8:10) <strong>SALAZAR SLYTHERIN IS WEARING A DRESS AND WIG</strong></p><p>(8:10) <strong>AND MAKE UP</strong></p><p>(8:10) <strong>Like.

It has a treasure chest in it and everything.</strong></p><p>(10:35) <em>Are you spoiling Sheba?</em></p><p>(10:37) <strong>They deserve nothing but the best, Moony.

Eating a donut. Bc Prongs is already in his Grand Final Mode.</strong></p><p>(5:09) <strong>So we have to eat healthy and exercise everyday until game day.</strong></p><p>(5:10) <em>I think Prongs and Alice would get on very well.</em></p><p>(5:11) <strong>They’d be the most terrifying personal trainers in the world.</strong></p><p>(5:12) <strong>So what are you doing?</strong></p><p>(5:13) <em>Packing. It feels like it’s all I ever do.</em></p><p>(5:14) <strong>What kind of strange socks have you ended up with this time?</strong></p><p>(5:16) <em>None, but I think this is Tonks’ hair brush.</em></p><p>(5:16) <em>No, I don’t think. It is. It has pink hair in it.</em></p><p>(5:18)<strong> Gross.</strong></p><p>(5:19) <em>I’ll leave it on her pillow.

Go to your party, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(5:23) <strong>I don’t mind sitting here talking to you, you know.</strong></p><p>(5:25) <em>Surely getting smashed would be more of an adventure.</em></p><p>(5:29) <strong>Not even remotely.</strong></p><p>(5:31) <strong>But if you’re really going to have dinner…</strong></p><p>(5:32) <em>Yeah, I told Tonks I’d help her pack up her things. The group also has to do a mass cleaning of the camp, anyway.</em></p><p>(5:33) <strong>Wow, I like how they made you do that AFTER you filled out their opinion survey.</strong></p><p>(5:34) <em>Mm, a true conspiracy.</em></p><p>(5:34) <em>I’ll talk to you later, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(5:35) <em>Congratulations on your win.</em></p><p>(5:36) <strong>Thank you, Moony.

</p><p>(9:40) <strong>Wormtail’s such a twat.</strong></p><p>(9:41) <em>He’s very insistent.</em></p><p>(9:42) <strong>I think he’s living vicariously.</strong></p><p>(9:42) <em>What happened to Freckles?</em></p><p>(9:43) <em>I hate that I can’t remember her name.</em></p><p>(9:44) <strong>We’re not allowed to mention Freckles bc Wormtail tripped in front of her the other day and now he’s mortified.</strong></p><p>(9:45)<em> Poor Wormtail.</em></p><p>(9:48) <strong>The guy killed your fuckin fish, Moony. Blood for blood!</strong></p><p>(9:48) <em>I think you’re more distressed over Sheba than what I am. Do you want to talk about it?</em></p><p>(9:50) <strong>No, I just feel bad that you entrusted me with your fish and I failed. I failed looking after a goldfish. That’s the lowest of lows.</strong></p><p>(9:51) <em>Padfoot, if you hadn’t killed them then I would have eventually.</em></p><p>(9:53) <strong>Still. So irresponsible that I killed a fish.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>Sirius?</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>Yeah?</strong></p><p>(9:56) <em>Is this jacket yours?</em></p><p>(9:59) <strong>Uh, what does it look like?</strong></p><p>(9:59) <em>Leather. Big.</em></p><p>(10:01) <strong>Doesn’t ring a bell.</strong></p><p>(10:02) <em>It has PADFOOT in large letters on the back.</em></p><p>(10:03) <strong>…Might be mine.</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>It was draped over the back of the desk chair.</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>Ah. I got tank water on it.</strong></p><p>(10:08) <em>It appears to be dry now.</em></p><p>(10:08) <em>Do you write your full name on the tags of all your clothes?</em></p><p>(10:08) <strong>Oh no</strong></p><p>(10:08) <strong>Shut up</strong></p><p>(10:10) <em>How precious.</em></p><p>(10:11) <strong>Stop</strong></p><p>(10:12) <em>Sirius Orion Black. In sharpie and all. Aw.</em></p><p>(10:12) <strong>So it doesn’t get lost, ok.</strong></p><p>(10:14) <em>I think PADFOOT would be a bit of a giveaway.</em></p><p>(10:14) <strong>It’s a habit, alright?</strong></p><p>(10:16) <em>Do you do it on your school shirts too?</em></p><p>(10:16) <em>How about socks?</em></p><p>(10:18) <em>Oh my god you label your socks.</em></p><p>(10:18) <strong>Mrs Potter insisted!!!!</strong></p><p>(10:19) <em>Yes, I’m sure this is entirely Mrs Potter’s fault.</em></p><p>(10:20) <strong>It totally is.</strong></p><p>(10:22) <em>I’m going out to brunch with mum now. Talk to you later, ickle Sirius.</em></p><p>(10:22) <strong>I hate you.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

  <u>Tuesday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:09) <em>I’m back to having to do actual work.</em></p><p>(9:10) <strong>Homeschool work. Hardly counts.</strong></p><p>(9:12) <em>It does so count.</em></p><p>(9:12) <em>You piss the teacher off and they’re mad at you for the entire day.</em></p><p>(9:13) <strong>…Moony, how could you possibly piss anyone off?</strong></p><p>(9:15) <em>Texting you, for one. A lot of people seem to get agitated at that.</em></p><p>(9:18) <strong>It’s bc they’re jealous I’m taking all your attention.</strong></p><p>(9:18) <em>Or they hate talking to the top of my head. Whichever.</em></p><p>(9:19) <strong>If you’re meant to be doing work then why are you texting me about doing work?</strong></p><p>(9:20) <em>Because I don't want to do work.</em></p><p>(9:22) <strong>Is my bad influence rubbing off on you?</strong></p><p>(9:22)<em> Yes. Stop it.</em></p><p>(9:23) <strong>No, no, I want to see how far this goes.</strong></p><p>(9:25) <em>I’ll be vandalizing walls soon.</em></p><p>(9:25) <strong>Graffiti on tables?</strong></p><p>(9:28)<em> It’s the kitchen table, I think that just might be a death wish.</em></p><p>(9:28) <strong>Especially if you draw a penis.</strong></p><p>(9:28) <em>…Why would I draw a penis?</em></p><p>(9:28) <em>Is this a gay joke?</em></p><p>(9:29) <strong>No? You went to a private school. Weren’t there penises drawn everywhere?</strong></p><p>(9:31) <em>Couldn't tell. Lockers are awfully dark when the doors are closed.</em></p><p>(9:32) <strong>Oh, Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:32) <strong>I’m sorry.</strong></p><p>(9:33) <em>It was a joke, don’t worry, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(9:34) <em>I wasn’t there very long and spent most of my time making sure I was doing the right thing, according to the rules and social expectations of being a teenager.</em></p><p>(9:35) <em>In other words, I was a bit distracted.</em></p><p>(9:36) <strong>Well, believe me Moony, I’m not compensating for my own behavior and what it could possibly mean as a reflection of my own psychology when I say EVERYONE GRAFFITIES PENISES.</strong></p><p>(9:38) <em>But whyyy?</em></p><p>(9:40) <strong>I just don’t know. I really don't know. It’s a miracle if you sit at a desk and there isn’t a penis drawn on the table.</strong></p><p>(9:41) <em>What about vaginas? Do they get their share in the graffiti adventure?</em></p><p>(9:43) <strong>Hardly. If they are drawn it’s mostly anatomically inaccurate. And usually attached to a body.</strong></p><p>(9:44) <em>Excellent. School is just free pornography.</em></p><p>(9:45) <strong>…Yes, now that you mention it.</strong></p><p>(9:48) <em>I have truly missed out.</em></p><p>(9:48) <strong>You also get live demonstrations of couples making out during lunch.</strong></p><p>(9:49) <em>I’ve been to the cinemas with Alice and Frank. It’s not as dark as you think it is in there.</em></p><p>(9:50) <strong>Ew</strong></p><p>(9:51) <em>Yeah, it was. I threw popcorn at them and they didn’t notice until one landed in Frank’s mouth</em></p><p>(9:51) <em>And then Alice accidentally ate it.</em></p><p>(9:52) <strong>MOONY NO</strong></p><p>(9:53) <em>Yes, it was gross!</em></p><p>(9:53) <strong>WHY DID YOU SHARE THAT?</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>Shared trauma experience. Makes it easier?</em></p><p>(9:58) <strong>I don’t feel easy. Queasy, perhaps.</strong></p><p>(9:58) <em>She choked on it a little so it wasn't gross long. She started flailing.</em></p><p>(9:59) <strong>HAH. A little better.</strong></p><p>(10:00) <em>I’m not invited to the movies with them anymore.</em></p><p>(10:01) <strong>Ugh, why would you want to though.</strong></p><p>(10:02) <em>True</em></p><p>(10:02) <em>MUM’S BACK I NEED TO GO</em></p><p>(10:03) <strong>Don’t piss of the teacher, Moony!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(11:34) <u><strong><em>Heeeeeeello?</em></strong></u></p><p>(11:34) <strong>Uh</strong></p><p>(11:35) <strong>Hi</strong></p><p>(11:35) <strong>Who is this?</strong></p><p>(11:35) <strong><em><u>Who is this?</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:36) <strong>I asked first, mate.

Is this Sirius?</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:38) <strong>Who the fuck is this</strong></p><p>(11:38) <strong>If this is you Reg, I’m going to punch your fucking face in.</strong></p><p>(11:39) <strong><em><u>Woah, woah, no.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:39) <strong><em><u>It’s Alice!!!

I really don't want to be Reg at the moment, though.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:43) <strong>You’d never want to be Reg.</strong></p><p>(11:45) <strong>What’s up?</strong></p><p>(11:45) <strong>Oh God, is Remus ok?</strong></p><p>(11:46) <strong><em><u>Remus is fine.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:48) <strong><em><u>He doesn’t actually know I’m texting you thought so please don't tell him.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:49) <strong>Right. Ok. Well, it depends what you’re texting me for, I think.</strong></p><p>(11:50) <strong><em><u>Wow, Remus was right. You’re so noble.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:50) <strong>Uh</strong></p><p>(11:50) <strong><u><em>It’s his birthday next week.</em></u></strong></p><p>(11:52) <strong>Oh yeah. Right…</strong></p><p>(11:52) <u><em><strong>I was planning a party.

His parents are taking him out on his birthday so we get the day after</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:55) <strong><em><u>Was going to be the day before but Remus has told me extensively of your schedule so I know you have football.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:55) <strong><em><u>That’s creepy. Ignore that.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:56) <strong>Ok. Um. Is this an invitation?</strong></p><p>(11:58) <strong><em><u>No, this is a command. You have to be there.</u></em></strong></p><p>(11:59) <strong>Well, who else is going to be there? You.</strong></p><p>(11:59) <u><em><strong>Frank. I’ve also stolen Tonks’ number from Remus’ phone. She seems lovely.

Sirius says your parents don’t know about this and that they won’t be there.”</p><p>“<em>Uh – I feel like I should tell you it’s not what it sounds like.</em>”</p><p>“Regardless, I feel like it’s important I talk to you about the important of practicing safe-”</p><p>“<strong>Woah, Mrs P, that’s all good! Right, Remus, it’s all good? I’m holding the phone to her ear now.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>It’s definitely all good. Better than good.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Right? Remus will wear a chastity belt.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Why do I have to?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Moony, go with it, please.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’ll wear three chastity belts.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>See, Mrs P?

</p><p>(1:45) <strong>I am sorry and mortified.</strong></p><p>(1:45) <em>I am confused and a little shaken.</em></p><p>(1:47) <strong>Yeah, she has that affect on people.</strong></p><p>(1:47) <em>Oh, she’s lovely. But. To the point.</em></p><p>(1:49) <strong>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</strong></p><p>(1:49) <strong>Molly explained how she knew me and Prongs mentioned how I’ll actually be seeing you this week and… Well, Mrs Potter insisted she had a chat to you.</strong></p><p>(1:50) <em>So this is Prongs’ fault, yes?</em></p><p>(1:51) <strong>Correct. Absolutely. 100%</strong></p><p>(1:52) <em>But, you’re still allowed to come over… right?</em></p><p>(1:54) <strong>Yeah, Moony, totally. She was mostly making fun. I know for a fact she mailed Prongs condoms when he told her he started dating Redhind.</strong></p><p>(1:55) <em>This makes me feel a little better.</em></p><p>(1:55) <strong>It should. She didn’t even write a note or anything. Just condoms.</strong></p><p>(1:58) <em>What a remarkable woman. It’s surreal, though.</em></p><p>(1:58) <strong>What is?</strong></p><p>(1:59) <em>Molly being Gideon and Fabian’s sister. You know them. Me knowing Molly.</em></p><p>(1:59) <strong>We were always just one connection away.</strong></p><p>(1:59) <em>We were always meant to end up here, then.</em></p><p>(2:00) <strong>Yes. I like that.</strong></p><p>(2:00) <em>I was wondering… what exactly are we going to do on Saturday?</em></p><p>(2:00) <strong>If not having sex, you mean?</strong></p><p>(2:01) <em>Why do I always get trapped like this?</em></p><p>(2:02) <strong>You’re too innocent, Moony. Like a puppy.</strong></p><p>(2:03)<em> Or you’re just looking for it now.</em></p><p>(2:04) <strong>You get all flustered, it's lovely.</strong></p><p>(2:04) <em>Lovely?</em></p><p>(2:05) <strong>Yes, I’m sticking by that.</strong></p><p>(2:06) <em>Whatever you say.</em></p><p>(2:06) <strong>Does that Play Station in your room still work?</strong></p><p>(2:08) <em>Yes, it works.</em></p><p>(2:08)<em> What do you mean by ‘still’? ‘Still works’?</em></p><p>(2:10) <strong>Moony, the thing’s ancient.</strong></p><p>(2:11) <em>It’s done well by me.</em></p><p>(2:13)<strong> Well used, I’m sure.</strong></p><p>(2:13) <strong>What games do you have?</strong></p><p>(2:14) <em>Uh. Crash Bandicoot and Need For Speed.</em></p><p>(2:16) <strong>Soooooo ancient.</strong></p><p>(2:16) <em>Be quiet.</em></p><p>(2:18) <strong>I look forward to playing your ancient games on your ancient machine.</strong></p><p>(2:20) <em>Is now the time to tell you it’s vintage?</em></p><p>(2:21) <strong>Hipster.</strong></p><p>(2:22) <em>Fuck.</em></p><p>(2:23) <strong>Will you be wearing the glasses on Saturday?</strong></p><p>(2:25) <em>Oh, God, no.</em></p><p>(2:25) <strong>Whyyyy noooot</strong></p><p>(2:26) <em>Because I won’t be reading.</em></p><p>(2:27) <strong>You’re killing me, Moons.</strong></p><p>(2:28) <em>It was my aim all along.</em></p><p>(2:30) <strong>Prongs is calling for early training, the fucking arsehole. I’ll talk to you later.</strong></p><p>(2:30) <em>Ok.

  <u>Friday AM</u>
</p><p>(8:56) <strong>So the counter-pranksters didn't emerge yesterday. It’s been a while since they’ve done something.</strong></p><p>(8:57) <em>Maybe they are dormant?</em></p><p>(8:57) <strong>Or planning something big.</strong></p><p>(8:59) <em>Is there some kind of event going on over there?</em></p><p>(9:05) <strong>Just the final on Sunday.</strong></p><p>(9:06) <em>Be careful, then.</em></p><p>(9:07) <strong>They wouldn't dare. Would they? Who in their right mind would sabotage a football match?</strong></p><p>(9:07) <strong>Actually, don’t answer that.</strong></p><p>(9:07) <em>Why not?</em></p><p>(9:08)<strong><em> You would think it’s funny, wouldn't you? You’re not really into sport.</em></strong></p><p>(9:08) <em>How dare you. I like to watch sport.</em></p><p>(9:09) <strong>Moony, perving on the players does not count as enjoying sport.</strong></p><p>(9:10)<em> I know, Alice keeps trying to tell me.</em></p><p>(9:10) <em>Do you think they’ll do something on Sunday?</em></p><p>(9:11) <strong>I don’t know. God, I hope not. I have Slytherins to punch.</strong></p><p>(9:13) <em>Punching them would get you disqualified from the game.</em></p><p>(9:13) <strong>It would feel good, though.</strong></p><p>(9:15) <em>You say I’m the violent one.</em></p><p>(9:17) <strong>We can both me mobsters. Gang partners in crime.</strong></p><p>(9:18) <em>Definitely not in a gang, huh?</em></p><p>(9:18)<em> Look, you even have a gang jacket.</em></p><p>(9:19) <strong>It's not a gang jacket! If it was, you, Prongs, and Wormtail would have one too.</strong></p><p>(9:19) <strong>And we’d all ride around on our motorbikes terrorizing people.</strong></p><p>(9:20) <em>You don’t already do that?</em></p><p>(9:21) <strong>I do not terrorize people.</strong></p><p>(9:22) <em>Your illegal driving is terrifying enough.</em></p><p>(9:23) <strong>Ha-ha. My driving is fine.</strong></p><p>(9:23) <strong>I wear a helmet and everything.</strong></p><p>(9:24) <em>Is this meant to be reassuring?

  <u>Friday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(12:39) <strong>Moony, I have a strong suspect.</strong></p><p>(12:39) <strong>Foot pursuit in action.</strong></p><p>(12:39) <strong>I have Operative Wormtail with me.</strong></p><p>(12:40) <strong>Are you available for communication? Over.</strong></p><p>(12:41) <em>Yes, whatever that means.</em></p><p>
  <strong> <em>[Answer: Padfoot]</em> </strong>
</p><p>“<em>Who’s your suspect?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Dorcas. I overheard her talking on the phone to someone about a ‘shipment.’ Whatever this shipment is, it’s here. She’s going to collect it now.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>And you managed to drag Wormtail with you?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>We have a spare period now and he has no other friends.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Is that him I can hear swearing at you?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yes, that’s him. Oi, Wormy –</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Moony, please make him stop this.</u>”</p><p>“<em>I don’t think I can, it’s too amusing listening to him fail.</em>”</p><p>“<u>Hah – Moony thinks you’re a failure.</u>”</p><p>“<em>That’s not what I said at all!</em>”</p><p>“<u>Give it back –</u>”</p><p>“<strong>I know you’d never say something like that, Moony. Right?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Of course not. I was commenting on your failure to capture the counter-pranksters.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>But I’m getting close, I can feel it. Hang on, I’m putting you on speaker.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Why do you need me here?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>You were here from the beginning, Moony. Now you shall see the end.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>I think you’ve got too much faith in this lead, mate. Dorcas could just be getting a package from her mum.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>She said shipment, Wormy. What kind of stuff does your mother ship you?</strong>”</p><p>“<u>I still reckon it’s weird that we’re following her, Pads.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>We’re not going to do anything to her, relax. Jeez, what do you take me for?</strong>”</p><p>“<u>A stalker. Right, Moony, he’s a stalker?</u>”</p><p>“<em>I don’t really think I can comment on that, given I’m the one that told him my address.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Thank you, Moony.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Bad judgment on your part, mate.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Wormtail, would you keep your voice down?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Where the hell are you two?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>We’re in the garden, near the Whomping Willow. Car park isn’t far from here, that’s where the truck will be – ah, there it is.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>That thing’s fuckin’ huge.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>It’s a truck, Wormtail, relax.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Big truck, though.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok, ok, she’s talking to the driver.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Is there anyone else around there?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Nah, it’s class time for most of the school. Just us. Windows don’t face this way, either. She’s perfectly concealed. This was the plan!</strong>”</p><p>“<u>You’re reading too much into this.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Wormtail, don’t make me turn this car around.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Oh, please do.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok, she’s signing something for the driver…</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Contract to her soul?</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Wormtail, shut up.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>He has a fair point. How else is she paying for this shipment?</em>”</p><p>“<u>It’s big, too.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Be quiet, you two.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Pads, we can’t hear shit from this distance.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>I just don’t want you talking anymore.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>And what about Moony?</u>”</p><p>“<strong>He’s only encouraging you. Shut up!</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Hey Moony, has Padfoot told you about the time in first year when he took Dorcas out on a date –</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Wormtail, you little rat!</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Oh, that was the girl you’re currently stalking now, is it? And you ate all that pink cake?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Moony, it’s not –</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Calm down, Padfoot. I’m making fun.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Wormtail, you are henceforth banned from making any comments.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Aw, Moony doesn’t mind. Right?</u>”</p><p>“<strong>I said no comments. Look, they’re unloading the truck now.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Are they…</u>”</p><p>“<strong>That’s going to go right into the lake. What’s the point?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>What’s happening?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>They’re pulling a bunch of ropes to drag this… thing out.

What the fuck is that?</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Are those tentacles?</u>”</p><p>“<strong>Don’t be a dickhead, Pete – oh, my God, they’re tentacles.</strong>”</p><p>“<u>Who’s the dickhead now?</u>”</p><p>“<em>I’m sorry, I’m going to need more description for this end.</em>”</p><p>“<u>It’s a giant fucking squid.</u>”</p><p>“<em>What?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Wormtail’s right. It’s just a giant fucking squid.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>A real one?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Don’t think so, but it looks like it.

It’s this rubbery stuff that you can cast into a mold.</u>”</p><p>“<strong>They made a silicone squid.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>They made a silicone squid?

  <u>Friday PM</u>
</p><p>(3:08)<em> I’m now a little concerned that you will literally stalk this poor girl.</em></p><p>(3:09) <strong>Why do you and Wormtail seem to think I’m a creep with no boundaries?</strong></p><p>(3:09) <strong>I’m just going to take note of whom she talks to. And then find a correlation between Dorcas missing and her friends missing at the same time.</strong></p><p>(3:10) <em>What’s the squid reaction been like?</em></p><p>(3:11) <strong>Oh yeah, everyone freaked out. Someone thought it was a real squid and fainted.</strong></p><p>(3:12) <em>Are they ok?</em></p><p>(3:12) <strong>Oh, they’re fine. The squid’s tentacles actually kinda float on the surface so that’s a bit of a giveaway.</strong></p><p>(3:14) <em>Is this constructive criticism or bitterness?</em></p><p>(3:15) <strong>Shush, I’m still the pranking master.</strong></p><p>(3:16) <em>I’m sure, Padfoot. I’m sure.</em></p><p>(3:18) <strong>Prongs was very impressed. He looked like it was Christmas.</strong></p><p>(3:19)<em> It’s not everyday you see a giant squid.</em></p><p>(3:20) <strong>Or you see a Moony. Tomorrow still happening?</strong></p><p>(3:21) <em>Yes. Very much yes.</em></p><p>(3:22) <strong>Good. Ok. Cool.</strong></p><p>(3:24) <em>I should get some work done so I don’t have any tomorrow.</em></p><p>(3:24) <strong>Your mum makes you do work on the weekend?</strong></p><p>(3:26) <em>If I don’t finish it because I’m talking to fools, then yes.</em></p><p>(3:30) <strong>Work like the speed of light, Moonbeam.</strong></p><p>(3:31) <em>I plan to.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(6:12) <em>Do you have any allergies?</em></p><p>(6:14) <strong>Uh, no. None I’ve discovered yet.</strong></p><p>(6:15) <em>Ok. Just, you know, so I don’t accidentally kill you with food tomorrow.</em></p><p>(6:17) <strong>Oh, but what a pleasant death it would be.</strong></p><p>(6:17) <strong>Dying in your arms.</strong></p><p>(6:19) <em>More like dying on my kitchen floor.</em></p><p>(6:19) <strong>You wouldn't hold me until my final breath?</strong></p><p>(6:20) <em>If you’re asphyxiating then your final breath might be very soon. Too soon to scoop you up into my arms.</em></p><p>(6:21) <strong>Why am I not in your arms in the first place?</strong></p><p>(6:22) <em>Dare I ask what position we are in while this is happening?</em></p><p>(6:25) <strong>A very dangerous question indeed, Moony.</strong></p><p>(6:29)<em> Forget I asked then. It doesn't need to be something I’m thinking about when I first see you.</em></p><p>(6:31) <strong>And why ever not?</strong></p><p>(6:42) <strong>Moony?</strong></p><p>(6:43) <em>Sorry, I’m dying of embarrassment over here.

  <u>Saturday AM</u>
</p><p>His parents had left the house not ten minutes ago, but it still gave Remus way too much time to flit about the house tidying random items and wiping his sweaty hands on his jeans. Alice was buzzing encouraging words in his pocket, but every time he checked his phone he was disappointed to see it wasn't Sirius. He was so used to it being Sirius.</p><p>(9:13) <strong><em><u>I know you, and I know you’ll be freaking out, but it will be fine. I promise!!</u></em></strong></p><p>But soon Sirius won’t just be a concept in his phone. Soon, too soon, Sirius will be standing before him. Too soon and all too far away, Remus will finally have a face to the voice that had soothed him for so many weeks.</p><p>He was going to be sick.</p><p>(9:16) <strong><em><u>Look, I’m assuming you’re reading these messages and are just too nervous to reply. Remember breathing exercises! Calming! Meditate, or something.</u></em></strong></p><p>Remus took two deep breaths before he gave up.</p><p>Every passing car, every honk of someone’s horn or the shouting of the neighbours, was Sirius. Remus tried not to look like an excited dog, chasing to the window at each sound, but he was afraid he failed miserably. He just hoped that when it finally was Sirius, the boy wouldn’t see Remus run to the window and peek through the curtains. Remus had to try and play it cool.</p><p>(9:24) <strong><em><u>Frank wishes you luck! He also made a joke about your kissing abilities but I think it’s too soon for that.</u></em></strong></p><p>He tried sitting at the kitchen table, but it was too still, and his jiggling knee kept hitting the tabletop. He would probably have a bruise there.</p><p>(9:30) <strong><em><u>Good luck, Remus. Try not to look too much like an idiot.</u></em></strong></p><p>(9:31) <strong><em><u>Oh my god!! That was a joke. A bad joke. You don’t need to hear stuff like that.</u></em></strong></p><p>His thighs were soaked from his sweaty hands, and he was about to go change when there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Remus’ heart was in his mouth, and taking a few shaky breaths stepped carefully to the door and opened it slowly.</p><p>There was a brief moment of confusion until Remus realized it was a deliveryman.</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Remus breathed. The deliveryman grunted at him, shoving a parcel into his arms and storming off his front lawn.</p><p>Remus was about to close the door when he heard a familiar voice sing, “What did you do to piss him off so much?”</p><p>Remus nearly dropped the parcel. </p><p>*</p><p>Sirius nearly kicked the bike over when it failed to start the third time.</p><p>James was behind him, texting Lily and being entirely unhelpful while Sirius was ten minutes late leaving the school grounds.</p><p>His foot was raised in the air when he considered kicking the bike might make it hate him. And he couldn't have Elvendork hate him, not now of all times.</p><p>He had a Moony to catch.</p><p>“Ok, ok,” James’ voice called, “Um… I’m sure you will be the bomb.”</p><p>“’The bomb’?” Sirius shouted over his shoulder, “That’s the best encouragement you have? That I’ll be ‘the bomb’?”</p><p>“The bomb diggity? Look, I’ve used up my yearly quota of encouraging you, man,” James whined, “You’re too high strung to be encouraged right now, anyway.”</p><p>Sirius glared down at his bike, once thought to be his child, his baby, but now a traitor to the cause. He wanted to cry.</p><p>“I wonder why I’m so high strung.”</p><p>“Don’t get pitiful, now. Have you tried singing to her?”</p><p>Sirius turned to James, his eyebrows raised. “My bike is not a woman. My bike is a bike. But, no, I’ve not tried singing to it.”</p><p>James held up his hands in mock surrender. “Sorry, sorry. Caressing its fenders, then? Whispering sweet nothings into its exhaust?”</p><p>“You’re fucking useless,” Sirius told him and wedged his helmet over his head once again. He turned the key gently this time, but when it still failed to start, he began twisting it erratically. He was getting fed up, and James’ lack of motivation all morning had started to wear on his nerves. He felt like he were on fire inside, his stomach a hot furnace, ready to burn him alive.</p><p>Sirius Black was terrified, but there was no way in hell he was telling anyone that.</p><p>With a final battle cry, Sirius twisted the key in the ignition, and finally the bike sputtered into life.</p><p>“Fuck yes!” He heard James shout over the engine and Sirius couldn’t help but beam.</p><p>His friend’s heavy hand came down on his shoulder, and through the helmet and over the engine he heard James tell him, “You are the bomb diggity and your Moony is awaiting. Go kill it, Pads.”</p><p>James saluted him as Sirius sped away, already sending a message to Lily.</p><p>(9:02) He’s shitting himself.</p><p>Sirius broke most of the speeding laws, not even bothering to check how fast he was going, so long as he got to Moony’s house quickly. He was scared he would turn back if it took too long.</p><p>He knew driving and texting was a bad idea, even Sirius wasn’t that reckless, but his heart sped up to match his accelerating bike when he felt a vibration against his thigh.</p><p>Slowing down ever so slightly, he pulled his phone out of his pocket to check the message. He almost piffed the phone into the sidewalk when he saw who it was from.</p><p>(9:22) <u>Good luck today!! Sorry I couldn’t see you off. Tell Moony I say hi. Actually, don’t mention me. He’s probably still mad about the fish thing. Shit. Well. Bye!</u></p><p>When Sirius pulled up across the street from Remus’ house he nearly hit the neighbour’s wheelie bins. When he saw the angry man stalking off Remus’ lawn he panicked that he’d taken a wrong turn.</p><p>But there, in the doorway looking utterly perplexed, stood a golden boy holding a box far too large for his arms, his face just as pale as Sirius felt.</p><p>He couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“What did you do to piss him off so much?" </p><p>*</p><p>Remus couldn’t think to do anything else but stare. If Alice were there, she would consider this something ‘idiotic,’ but the will from Remus drained from him the moment he finally saw Sirius.</p><p>It was stupid, entirely ridiculous, that this had been the boy to flirt with him for months. He looked like someone from those greaser movies, far too pretty to really be a thug but playing the part well. The only telltale sign that he could really belong to a greaser group was the haphazard bandage on his right arm from his wrist to over his elbow.</p><p>He practically strutted across the road and up Remus’ lawn, his boots scraping on the pavement and shaking his hair out of the helmet. Remus was horrified at his simple white tee shirt, a chill already spilling down his own spine from the breeze through the open door.</p><p>He wondered why Sirius wasn’t wearing a jacket.</p><p>When Sirius swallowed his Adam’s apple bobbed, and he dragged a hand through his long hair, and Remus only belatedly noticed these to be nervous tics. He had been staring too long.</p><p>“I swore at him,” he almost shouted. Sirius seemed startled at the exclamation, tilting his head and smiling shyly.</p><p>“What?” He asked, and Remus hoped that he was just distracted too, and that Remus hadn’t already said something stupid.</p><p>“I swore at the deliveryman,” he clarified, rushing on, “I thought… I thought he would be you, and then he wasn’t, and well… It’s been a very long morning. Will you come in?” Remus hoped to get his words out before they tumbled into nonsense off his dry tongue, and was relieved when Sirius nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>Remus dropped the parcel by his front door, opening it wider to let Sirius in. Despite having been there before, Sirius entered slowly, discarding his big boots by the front door and turning his head to take in the front landing.</p><p>“It’s the same as it was last week,” Remus joked. His mind felt like it had come to a blank, and he was clutching at anything to say, even the most pathetic jokes his brain could supply.</p><p>Sirius smiled at him. “Only now it’s got better décor,” he said easily but a red bloom spread on his cheeks.</p><p>Remus felt his face grow hot too, and really he should have expected it, it wasn’t like Sirius was a different person now that he was here. He swallowed thickly, hoping he could make it through this first meeting without combusting.</p><p>He was closing the door behind Sirius when he saw the bike, left unceremoniously on the nature strip in front of old Moody’s house across the street.</p><p>“Did you drive that thing here?” Remus asked him.</p><p>“Uh, yeah?”</p><p>Remus shook his head and poked Sirius in the arm. “And what about this? You drove a motorcycle here with a healing arm?”</p><p>“And look!” Sirius spread his arms over his head, “No injuries!”</p><p>Remus shook his head again, tearing his eyes away from the small strip of skin exposed from Sirius’ ridden-up shirt. The bastard probably did it on purpose, and judging by the way he stood just a little too close to Remus, the guess was right.</p><p>Remus felt rooted to the spot. No amount of will could force his feet to move him, his lips to talk, and part of him didn’t want to anyway. It was surreal, having Sirius right in front of him, and if the entire world could stand still Remus would spend it looking at Sirius.</p><p>He only half registered that his lips were moving soundlessly, having for the very first time nothing to say to Sirius.</p><p>Sirius in turn looked amused, and Remus decided he was definitely a bastard, as the boy made no attempt to fill in the stretching silence. He grinned at Remus, leaning casually against the wall, and watched as Remus failed to form sounds from his throat.</p><p>Remus coughed lightly. “I’ve waited for this for so long and suddenly I don’t have a thing to say,” he admitted.</p><p>Sirius nodded, his smile never faltering. “It’s good to see you, though.”</p><p>The heat in the house could stifle them both death, and Remus had to keep fighting down the panic erupting in his chest. “It’s good to see you too,” he mumbled.</p><p>“I did come here for an objective,” Sirius said, “If we would like to start there?”</p><p>“Objective?” Remus blanked.</p><p>“The jacket, Moony,” Sirius threw his arms up in air again, “Please tell me you haven’t forgotten about the jacket?”</p><p>It was the dramatic tone that set Remus alive again, the familiarity of it all, as if Sirius had been a permanent fixture in all his life. He smiled easily, feeling the tension leave his body.</p><p>“Oh, you mean your gang jacket?” Remus teased, “Sorry, but I’ve been a bit distracted of late.”</p><p>Remus’ feet finally allowed him to walk down his own hall, not waiting to see if Sirius was following.</p><p>“Distracted?” Sirius’ voice said closely behind him.</p><p>“Yes, you see, I just had a stray dog turn up on my doorstep.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, “I bet he’s cute, though.”</p><p>They had reached Remus’ bedroom door, and it was only with his sweaty hand on the door handle did Remus really consider the implications. He was home alone with a gorgeous boy he’d been a little more than crushing on for two months, and was now about to lead him into his bedroom. Although Remus didn’t think things would go that far, didn’t think he’d want them to go that far just yet, the thought of it alone made his face hot. He hoped Sirius couldn’t tell.</p><p>Remus replied, “He is cute.” Turned the handle, “And he knows it.”</p><p>Remus turned to watch the blush flare on Sirius’ cheeks, satisfied he wasn't the only one. Maybe he’d make it out alive, after all.</p><p>Remus’ bedroom was small, but able to fit a single bed, a desk and bookcase. Hanging over the back of the desk chair was the leather jacket, all pins and buttons intact, and the emblazoned letters PADFOOT shouted at them in greeting. Sirius pulled it off the chair, easily swooping it on, testing his size as if wearing it for the first time.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I didn’t accidentally kill it and replace it with a poor copy.” Sirius seemed to flinch, making Remus feel instantly guilty. “It was a joke. Sorry.”</p><p>Sirius sat in the chair, spinning it around to press his face up against the tank containing Sheba the Second.</p><p>“I’m sorry my roommate is a dipshit and got your fish killed,” Sirius said sincerely.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Remus dropped himself onto his bed, leaning his back against the wall and watching Sirius swivel himself around in the chair.</p><p>“Wormtail says hi, by the way, but he told me not to tell you in case you were still mad about the fish thing.”</p><p>Remus smiled and shook his head, “I was never mad about the fish thing.”</p><p>“You’re taking the death of our beloved Sheba remarkably well,” Sirius said.</p><p>There was a buzz in Remus’ pocket, and without having to look he knew who it was. He was going to kill her.</p><p>“I guess we didn’t really bond. I was interested in talking to someone else.”</p><p>“Moony,” Sirius smiled, “You’re so sly.”</p><p>Remus laughed, watching his hands pull and twist at the hem of jumper, feeling his face glow again. “I’ve had practice, I guess.”</p><p>“Mm,” Sirius hummed, “No one talks to Sirius Black without picking up a few things.”</p><p>Remus looked up, “I meant Prongs.”</p><p>Sirius mock gasped, poking his tongue out at Remus but smiling. Remus laughed too, trying not to think too long about Sirius’ pink tongue but failing miserably.</p><p>His phone buzzed again.</p><p>“You going to get that?” Sirius sounded amused.</p><p>“No,” but when the phone buzzed once more Remus groaned, “Yes." </p><p>(9:45) <strong><em><u>Is he there?? How’s it going??</u></em></strong></p><p>(9:46) <strong><em><u>Remus?? Tell me you’ve not spiraled into self pity.</u></em></strong></p><p>(9:47) <strong><em><u>Or, wait, unless he’s actually there. Is he there?! WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?</u></em></strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>Go away!!</em></p><p>Remus switched his phone off and threw it at his pillow. Sirius was staring at him, the same amused grin plastered on his face, and raised an eyebrow at Remus’ exasperation.</p><p>“Alice,” he said simply, making Sirius bark out a laugh.</p><p>“I threatened Prongs and Wormtail that if they message me in the next few hours, I’ll run them over.”</p><p>Remus giggled, feeling giddy and out-of-body as Sirius continued to swing on the desk chair, looking so comfortable and natural in Remus’ environment. Remus liked the way he looked here.</p><p>Sirius turned to the desk and from behind Sheba’s tank plucked a permanent marker resting in a cup. Sirius dragged the chair closer to Remus’ bed until their knees were touching, and Sirius held out the marker to Remus.</p><p>Sirius smiled shyly. “I recall promising you that you can sign my cast. I don’t actually have a cast, but you can still write on the bandages, or whatever. I mean,” he trailed off, “If you want.”</p><p>Remus took the marker from him, and slowly reached for Sirius’ extended arm. Sirius leaned forward, his hair falling over his eyes, and gently resting his arm on Remus’ lap. Their knees were pressed together now, their feet entangled, and their faces very close together and watching Remus’ hand draw gently on the bandage.</p><p>“This thing is grotty,” Remus murmured, so close they were that he didn’t need to raise his voice at all.</p><p>The marker tip snagged on the material, making Remus trace over the same line a few times before it would show through, and so they sat close together for a while. They were silent, but it wasn’t awkward, and wasn’t expecting. Remus felt comfortable.</p><p>Eventually Remus capped the marker, staring down at his handiwork and determined to ignore the heavy beating of his heart.</p><p><em>Moony’s</em>.</p><p>Sirius beamed, his eyes flicking over the letters again and again, and then jumping out of the chair and collecting more pens from the desk.</p><p>He plopped himself next to Remus on the bed, crossing his legs and holding out his hand expectantly. Remus furrowed his brows, causing Sirius to roll his eyes and take Remus’ arm. He pulled up the sleeve of Remus’ oversized jumper to just above his elbow, and then laid Remus’ arm out on his lap. Sirius uncapped a black pen and began to draw.</p><p>The tip of the pen was cold on Remus’ skin, but he was instead paying attention to the warmth of Sirius’ hands, and the way his fingers glided over his skin gently. It felt like tiny feathers tickling his forearm, unsure but constant.</p><p>Remus watched him draw, the way he turned his awkwardly bandaged arm at different angles to do different strokes, smudging some areas with his left hand and blowing gently against Remus’ skin to dry the ink. Remus tried not to shudder.</p><p>“You know what you’re doing,” Remus commented quietly. Most of his view of the picture was blocked by Sirius’ arm, but Sirius had a look of concentration on his face, his brows furrowed and eyes fixed. “So, I’m adding drawing to the growing list of things you can do.”</p><p>“Well,” Sirius looked up to meet Remus’ eyes, “I’m not a professional or anything. Uh, a hobby. I mean, I’m not perfect at it.”</p><p>Remus laughed lightly. “Are you being modest? You?”</p><p>Sirius shoved him in the shoulder, “Be quiet. I’m working.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re definitely not a professional.” Sirius shoved him again, making Remus laugh at him harder. “You’re not drawing a penis on me, are you?”</p><p>Sirius gave a short laugh, “Would you be so adverse to it?”</p><p>“Hm, on my arm?” Remus replied sarcastically, “Maybe a little.”</p><p>“Be glad it’s not your face,” Sirius smiled.</p><p>“I feel like there’s a story here.”</p><p>Sirius chuckled. “Not done to me. But I have a whole series of photos of Prongs with dicks on his face.”</p><p>Sirius pulled his phone from his back pocket, unlocking it and opening his photos. He scrolled through the pictures, a smile suddenly breaking out as he handed Remus the phone.</p><p>The photo was blurry, but Remus could distinctly make out a sleeping face, sans glasses but marred by a black pen. “Is it…?”</p><p>Sirius leaned over Remus’ shoulder, zooming in the picture on the screen. Remus’ eyes took in nothing, his brain whirring over how close Sirius’ face was and with his chest pressed to Remus’ shoulder.</p><p>“Going into his mouth,” Sirius said triumphantly, apparently at ease with their closeness.</p><p>Remus began laughing, soon unable to control himself when Sirius started laughing too, the two of them stuck in fits of hysteria on the bed. Sirius head slumped to rest on Remus’ shaking shoulder.</p><p>Sirius’ laughter subsided when Remus began coughing, a sound like a heavy drum beat tearing from his chest. It sounded thick, suffocating, but Remus easily pulled some tissues from his sleeve and began coughing into it. His cheeks were turning red and his throat felt constricted, and it wasn’t anything he hadn’t dealt with before, but he could feel Sirius’ worried gaze on him.</p><p>Sirius stretched over to reach the desk, grabbing a bottle of water by his fingertips and gently pressing it into Remus’ hands. Remus was surprised by the gentle gesture, but quickly uncapped the bottle and took a swig.</p><p>He cleared his throat, taking mouthfuls from the bottle at intervals, and Sirius just sat and watched him, hoping the glistening in his eyes was from the laughter instead of choking.</p><p>After a few moments the coughing subsided, but when Remus apologized his throat was croaky.</p><p>“It’s the damp weather,” he said, “Don’t ask why.”</p><p>“No need to apologize,” Sirius said lightly, and took Remus’ arm when he offered it. “Are you… Uh –”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Remus assured him, his voice coming through clearer and stronger after each word. “Please, keep going.”</p><p>Sirius obliged easily, studying his work and picking up the blue pen.</p><p>Remus kept watching him draw, but his eyes wavered from Sirius’ drawing to his face, lingering there just a little too long. Sirius peeked through his curtain of hair, catching Remus’ eye and raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“You’re worrying about coughing in front of me,” he said.</p><p>How quickly they had learned wordless communication.</p><p>“It’s not the most attractive thing in the world,” Remus admitted.</p><p>The corner of Sirius’ mouth twitched. “Call me biased, but everything about you is attractive, Remus. Even your phlegmy coughing.”</p><p>Remus couldn't stop the smile that spread on his lips, and he quickly looked away embarrassed, rubbing his free hand over his warm face.</p><p>“Will you ever stop blushing?” Sirius poked him in the cheek, “Not that I mind it.”</p><p>Remus swatted his hand away, but Sirius caught it in his own and linked their fingers together.</p><p>Remus’ whole body felt hot now. Their hands were sliding together smoothly, fingertips tracing grooves and light flecks of scars, oil burn when Remus tried helping cook as a child, jagged metal snagging Sirius’ palm in Elvendork’s construction. When Remus splayed his fingers out, Sirius filled in the spaces with his own fingers, closing their hands together like a perfect fit.</p><p>Remus doesn't know when, but at some point the both of them had slumped on the bed, now laying side by side with their legs dangling over the edge. Remus had been so enrapt with their playing hands that he hardly registered the half-finished drawing on his forearm.</p><p>“You drew a dog,” he said amused.</p><p>“What else would I draw?”</p><p>“You drew a self portrait.”</p><p>Sirius huffed a laugh, but his tone was sincere when he asked, “Moony, did your wish come true?”</p><p>Remus furrowed his brow. “What wish?”</p><p>“Your eleven-eleven wish. You said you’d tell me if it came true.”</p><p>They were touching from shoulder to ankle, their sides and legs pressed together, and Remus hooked his ankle around Sirius’.  The position was very casual, but Remus felt a charge, like he was a lit fuse ready to crackle. He tried to tame the bubbling in his chest as he rested his head against Sirius’.</p><p>“Padfoot, what do you think my wish was?”</p><p>Both of their bodies shook when Sirius shrugged. Remus blew air out of his nose, a small laugh, sending a shiver down Sirius’ spine.</p><p>“I wished for you, you ponce.”</p><p>Sirius looked up at him, their faces level and close, so close that Remus could see the detail of his bottom lashes sweeping his cheek, the small cuts where Sirius had been biting his lips, where he now bit his lips…</p><p>Remus didn’t realize he was staring, didn’t mean to, but suddenly he noticed Sirius’ breath on his face, and the boy’s nose nudging against his. His heart was on fire, a bomb ready to ignite at any moment.</p><p>He heard a car door slam.</p><p>Sirius heard it too, and they both jumped, startled, and the bomb in Remus’ chest was about to explode, but only this time it was from fear.</p><p>“Shit,” he hissed, “Shit, shit, shit.”</p><p>Sirius looked hurt as Remus flung himself off the bed and darted out of the room, standing in the hallway for a moment before he came charging back in, still swearing under his breath.</p><p>Sirius’ face was like a fresh bloom of roses, and it fought against Remus’ being to tell him, “You need to go.”</p><p>Outside, another car door slam.</p><p>“My parents are home.”</p><p>Sirius leapt off the bed, ready to charge out the room when Remus caught him by the arm and began dragging him to the window over the desk.</p><p>“Can’t go out the front door, fool.” He almost sounded fond, “Or they’ll see you right there.”</p><p>“So your alternative is to throw me out the window?” Sirius snorted. “You really do love those romantic comedies, don’t you?”</p><p>Remus threw open the window, dragging Sheba the Second’s bowl over to give Sirius more climbing space. He didn’t bother to move the sheets of paper or books scattered on its top, and Sirius easily climbed on.</p><p>Sirius was sitting on the windowsill, one leg in the house and one leg out, when Hope Lupin shouted out to her son that they were home.</p><p>Remus poked Sirius to get him moving, but Sirius said, “Wait, Moony, I’ve got a question.”</p><p>“Now?!” Remus panicked.</p><p>“What are you doing tomorrow?”</p><p>“Is now really the time, Padfoot,” Remus deadpanned.</p><p>“It’s my final tomorrow,” Sirius said indignant, “Will you come watch? You can bring Alice.”</p><p>In the kitchen, Lyall was shouting about how Remus hadn’t come out to greet them yet.</p><p>Remus couldn’t help but smile at the puppy-dog eyes Sirius was giving him. “Of course. Text me when and where. Right now you need to get out my room.”</p><p>Sirius flashed a grin, hesitating slightly as he swooped in to give Remus a lingering kiss on the cheek, a little close to his mouth but not quite his lips, and then swinging himself out the window.</p><p>Remus waited for the roar of the motorbike engine before declaring it safe, leaving his room and walking casually to the kitchen.</p><p>“How was your morning, love?” Hope asked and Remus just shrugged.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>*</p><p>

  <u>Sunday PM</u>
</p><p>The sky was clearer than what it was the previous day, Sirius taking it as a good omen. He could already feel sweat trickle down his brow, the neck of his jersey sticking to his skin, but the game had not even yet started. His hands shook, but it wasn’t from exhaustion or the anticipation of the game. He jumped on the spot, rolling his shoulders, and pointedly jabbing James in the back with his elbows.</p><p>“What if he doesn’t show up?” Sirius hissed in his ear.</p><p>James shrugged him off like an annoying fly, already irritable with Sirius’ anxious mood. “Mate, he’ll show, can you just concentrate on what’s important here?”</p><p>“You need to relax,” Sirius told him, but James just scuffed him up the back of the head.</p><p>“Like you’re one to talk. You stop freaking out about Remus and I’ll calm down enough to not murder anyone today. Especially you.”</p><p>The team were all stretching in a circle, muttering to each other about the opposition on the other end of the pitch, who were doing much the same. The pitch was nearly fluorescent green, but soon to be pocketed with pits of mud from studded boots.</p><p>Peter was telling Barty about how he’s going to punch Malfoy right in the jaw once the game finishes.</p><p>“That’s just assault, Wormtail,” James called out, but Peter shrugged.</p><p>“Not a lot of bashing opportunities when you’re goalie, you know? You guys get all the fun.”</p><p>James stood in the center of the circle, spinning on the spot as he spoke. “Absolutely no one here is allowed to hit anyone else. Do you understand? I do not want anyone on my team being benched today. It’s too important. You’re all needed. Sirius, I’m specifically talking to you when I say this.”</p><p>Sirius tried to look innocent. “What on Earth would I do?”</p><p>The rest of the team laughed, but James put his arm around Sirius’ shoulders and whispered in his ear, “Honestly, mate. Don’t hit ‘im.”</p><p>“Hit who?” Sirius flashed him a smile, but James wasn’t so convinced. Sirius slumped, “Yeah, yeah, I know. I won’t hit him.”</p><p>James thumped him on the back. “Good lad.”</p><p>“Oi, Sirius,” Peter called out, “What word did you use yesterday to describe Moony? I can’t remember.”</p><p>Sirius put up his middle finger. “Fuck off, Pete.”</p><p>James joined in, “Oh, I think I remember, Wormtail. Something like earthal? Auraful?”</p><p>“Ethereal!” Peter exclaimed, “He said Moony was ethereal.”</p><p>“How poetic,” a small voice behind him said, and Sirius nearly broke his neck turning to see who it was.</p><p>Remus was standing on the pitch, smiling shyly and wringing his hands in his sleeves. A pretty, peppy girl was beside him, a huge grin plastered on her face as she gripped Remus’ upper arm in a death hold.</p><p>Sirius felt his face grow hot, Peter’s cackling piercing his concentration as he turned to tell him to shut the hell up.</p><p>“Are we early?” Remus asked, looking around the pitch nervously. The game was due to start in ten minutes, and the stands were already filling out with families and friends. Bright red and yellow banners shone in the sunlight, happy colours in contrast to the mossy green and silver of Slytherin banners.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Sirius spotted the tall stride of his parents take the high seats of the stands. His heart caught in his chest, but his mind told him to ignore it.</p><p>“Not at all,” he managed to say, “Lily should be around somewhere – she’ll show you where to go. Prongs, where’s your girlfriend?”</p><p>James shrugged at the same time Alice stage whispered, “Are you going to introduce us?”</p><p>Remus whacked her in the arm, his cheeks visibly pinking. He mumbled, “Sirius, this is Alice. Alice, Sirius.”</p><p>Sirius stuck out his hand, like he’d been taught to do when meeting new people, realizing too late it was a trait carried over from his family. He swallowed thickly, croaking, “Hello, Alice. I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>Alice took his hand gladly, telling him, “And I about you.”</p><p>Remus cut in, “Let’s not go there,” as the referee blew her whistle to assemble the teams.</p><p>Alice began walking to the stands, but Remus stayed and grabbed Sirius by the arm, asking him if he was ok.</p><p>“I can leave, you know, if that’s the problem.” He bit his bottom lip.</p><p>Sirius scoffed, “Don't be silly, Moony.” He paused. “Mummy and Daddy are here, but for Regulus, no doubt.”</p><p>“Well, Alice and I are here for you.”</p><p>Over Remus’ shoulder, Sirius could see Alice hover at the edge of the pitch. “I definitely got the prettier cheerleaders.”</p><p>Remus poked him in the stomach. “Flirt.”</p><p>Sirius flashed him a grin, the whistle erupting in his ears again. James was shouting for him to hurry up, so Sirius roughly pulled Remus into a hug.</p><p>“Oh, hugging,” Remus sounded surprised, but amused as he wrapped his arms around Sirius’ neck.</p><p>Remus’ hair smelled like shampoo, and his body was soft from layers of jumpers. Sirius liked how solid he was, and the thought of <em>this is real</em> hit him full force that he gripped Remus a little tighter.</p><p>“They’re going to watch Regulus lose,” Remus whispered in his ear, sending a shiver down Sirius’ spine. “If you win, I’ll even kiss you in front of your parents.”</p><p>Sirius hardly had time to register his words when Remus was pulling away, a mischievous grin spread on his face. A spark lit up low in Sirius’ stomach.</p><p>“Is that another promise?” Sirius asked.</p><p>Remus smiled, “Good luck.” He began walking over to Alice when he turned and said, “Oh, Sirius?”</p><p>Sirius could hear James shouting abuse at him, but instead he replied, “Yeah?”</p><p>“Nice bun.”</p><p>Sirius reflexively brought his hand up to run through his hair, smiling at the ground as he slinked over to join the rest of his team and Remus found Alice at the stands.</p><p>They were already centered around the playing ball, James at the center spot with Slytherin captain Malfoy, waiting for the game to begin.</p><p>Surveying the crowd, Sirius spotted Remus and Alice seated beside Lily and her friend Marlene, Mrs Potter sitting behind them and tapping Lily enthusiastically on the shoulder as she spoke with her and Remus. Remus looks intimidated, but talked back with the woman. Mr Potter sat beside her, listening contently.</p><p>“James, your parents are already attacking Remus,” Sirius whined.</p><p>From the inner circle, James jogged on the spot and pulled faces at an unamused Malfoy. “Not my parents, our parents. You have to take responsibility for the embarrassing shit they do too.”</p><p>Behind James, Regulus stood statue still, ready and poised for the whistle to blow and the ball to be released. He didn't flinch when James’ called them <em>our parents</em>, not that Sirius was watching him.</p><p>“Regardless, they’re going to scare him away!”</p><p>“Oi, Black,” Gideon cut in, “As riveting as your love life is, now is not the time or place!”</p><p>Regulus’ head whipped to meet Sirius’ eyes, confusion painted on his face. Sirius’ stomach became a knot when he said, “Love life?”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. “Yeah, Reg, I have this uncanny ability of being able to care for another human being.”</p><p>Malfoy made an ugly snort, not even turning to face Sirius as he said, “Mm, but caring for another man, though. That’s a bit unsavory.”</p><p>James instantly stepped into Malfoy’s personal space, shouting “What are you trying to say?!” While Sirius broke the circle boundaries and screamed at him, “You shut the fuck up!”</p><p>Behind James’ head Sirius could see movement from Regulus, but his view was cut off when Madame Hooch stood in front of him, pushing him away from Malfoy and ordering him to get back in position.</p><p>He thought of Remus in the stands, thought of how sitting on the bench all game would be mortifying, and so clenching his fists stepped down from the fight.</p><p>Besides, winning was essential now.</p><p>*</p><p>It wasn’t hard for Remus to spot which one Regulus was. He had a similar set jaw, same dark hair and slender build as Sirius, but his posture was rigid and controlled, as if his skeleton was constricted in his pale skin. Sirius stood more easily, more carefree, making the sudden stiffness in shoulders more identifiable. Remus saw Regulus move from his statue pose, his heart setting in frenzy, hoping Sirius wouldn’t lose control.</p><p>“Sirius and Regulus are arguing already,” Lily tried to say lightly, but Remus could hear the strain in her voice.</p><p>“Well, you know Sirius,” Mrs Potter said behind them, just as strained, “Any chance he gets.”</p><p>Remus watched as James and Sirius leapt at the blonde haired boy in the middle simultaneously, both of them shouting and clawing at him. The boy just laughed as the referee tried to restrain them. Remus gripped the edge of his seat; behind him Mrs Potter was tittering.</p><p>“Will this game be particularly violent and brutal because it’s a final?” Remus asked.</p><p>He was relieved to see Sirius step down, taking his position once again at the outer circle, one leg in front of the other, ready to take off.</p><p>“Have you never seen a bunch of teenage boys play in a football final before?” Lily asked him.</p><p>Alice cut in, “No, Remus was more into the swimming.”</p><p>Lily and Mrs Potter laughed as Remus said, “At Alice’s insistence. Especially the synchronized diving. As she put it, double the fun.”</p><p>“Can’t disagree with that,” Lily threw her red hair over her shoulder, “Let’s just say that there’s already an ambulance waiting on the street.”</p><p>Remus groaned, “That doesn't fill me with confidence.”</p><p>The game had started, but Remus had quickly lost sight of where the ball was, too busy keeping an eye on Sirius and praying he doesn't cause himself or anyone else bodily injury.</p><p>Mrs Potter tapped him on the shoulder reassuringly. “He’ll be fine, love.”</p><p>Remus could hear the quiet muttering of James’ father behind him, urging on the boys on the pitch and tapping his foot lightly for emphasis. Although they weren’t far from the pitch, Remus found it hard to keep track of what was happening, trying to follow the line of the ball but always turning his attention back to where Sirius was running.</p><p>Remus thought those shorts were going to kill him.</p><p>“You weren’t lying when you said he was hot,” Alice whispered in his ear.</p><p>“I never said hot,” Remus whispered back, hoping Lily and the Potters couldn’t hear him, “I thought it would be too much of an understatement.”</p><p>Alice whistled, “No kidding. Can we share this one too?”</p><p>Remus was glad they were joking about it now, but while he laughed and told Alice to bugger off, a flare of possession burned in his chest.</p><p>Remus finally found the ball, as Sirius was dribbling it up the pitch to oppositions’ goals, just about to reach the goalkeeper’s line when a heavy set Slytherin player cut him off, sliding the ball away from his feet and tripping him over into the grass.</p><p>The Gryffindor spectators immediately roared in disdain, Lily and the Potters leaping from their seats in protest. Remus stood quickly, standing on the tips of his toes to watch Sirius pull himself from the ground, rolling his bandaged arm and giving James a thumbs up.</p><p>“What?” Lily sounded incredulous. “Is he <em>smiling</em>?”</p><p>“More importantly,” Mrs Potter added, “He’s not punching.”</p><p>The referee blew her whistle, taking the ball and setting it in the place Sirius was tripped, ordering Sirius a free penalty kick.</p><p>“He’d usually be building up a storm by now,” Lily commented.</p><p>Alice smiled, watching Remus from the corner of her eye. “I think he has incentive.”</p><p>Remus glared at her, which only served to make her laugh as his cheeks bloomed fresh red. “I regret bringing you,” he told her but she just stuck out her tongue.</p><p>On the pitch, Sirius was lining up to take the shot, but not before giving the goalkeeper, Rosier, a sarcastic wave. Sirius kicked the ball, gliding smoothly through the air and past Rosier’s large gloved hands, slipping past his fingers and into the goal.</p><p>The crowd exploded into victorious cheers, the stands shaking from the sudden upheaval and stamping of feet. Lily and the Potters were shouting in Remus’ ear, and even Alice had jumped up, waving her arms furiously in the air and cheering. Remus caught himself cheering too, beaming down at Sirius who was being drowned by his teammates. James was jumping on his back, rubbing his hair furiously and shouting in excitement.</p><p>Amongst all the booming, Remus caught Sirius’ eye, and the sound seemed to drain away, just the two of them watching, both with smiles plastered on their faces.</p><p>It didn’t last long, the referee’s whistle coming out in short bursts to settle the players and the crowd to commence the game. Alice was giving him an amused look, which Remus pointedly ignored, and took his seat again.</p><p>It was clear that Sirius’ goal had really set the game in motion, the opposition starting to stick their elbows out and exaggerating their falls a little too hard. The Gryffindors weren’t innocent of it either; Creswell running directly into Crabbe as the ball came their way, throwing them both to the ground and the referee calling a foul. James began swearing at Creswell, soon swearing at everyone and when the whistle sounded for half time his face flushed from shouting.</p><p>“He uses this opportunity to swear as much as he likes, because we won’t let him do it in the house,” Mrs Potter told them, Lily’s face turning as red as her hair from laughter.</p><p>They were only seated three levels up from the team’s bench, and so could hear James very clearly when he told his team, “If any of you prats even think about being carded this half, my boot is going to go so far up your arse –”</p><p>Peter cut in, “Well, Sirius –”</p><p>“Wormtail, do <em>not</em>!” Sirius warned.</p><p>Remus heard Alice laugh beside him.</p><p>“The two of you need to shut up and stop showing off in front of Moony. Wormtail, you nearly let one in before and don’t think I’m not going to hold it over you if you don’t shut up.”</p><p>Remus could feel the blush on the tips of his ears and Alice shaking from suppressed giggles beside him. Sirius looked up at him, smiled shyly, and then joined the huddled circle James had formed with the team.</p><p>The huddled Slytherins on the opposite side of the pitch looked calm, their resting faces were calculating, determined, and it made Remus all the more worried.</p><p>Remus waved nervously as the shrill of the whistle went, and Sirius ran onto the pitch once more. </p><p>*</p><p>Sirius was used to playing with so many people watching, normally forgetting they were there until a goal was scored or a foul was made and then the wave of yelling washed over him and he was brought back to the world.</p><p>He’d heard James say it was like having tunnel vision, the way you only concentrated on the game and nothing else around you. People could be dying in those stands, but Sirius wouldn’t have any idea.</p><p>But now, now of all games, Sirius felt eyes pinned to his back, burning him like lasers. He knew it was ridiculous, but they made him itch, and glancing quickly every now and then told him it was Moony, always Moony, not that he was surprised.</p><p>He was worried he would forget how to walk with Remus watching him so closely, but he somehow managed to score the game’s only goal thus far, and the look of admiration on Remus’ face was worth it all.</p><p>As soon as they were back on the pitch for the second half, Sirius knew the Slytherins were playing their defense man-on-man. Each red and yellow jersey had an accompanying green and silver, pairs dotted all over the pitch.</p><p>A small presence was beside him, and he didn’t need to look to know who’d been paired up with him.</p><p>“Of all the people you could pick?” Sirius grunted.</p><p>Regulus shrugged. “I thought we could take the time to talk,” he said quietly.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>The whistle cried and Sirius took off straight for the ball, not really to become immediately involved but to just get away, to try and shake Regulus off as quickly as he could.</p><p>But the boy was fast, Sirius had to give him that, as he easily trailed Sirius, not blocking in front of him but just following behind.</p><p>Sirius was instructed to stay on the opposition’s side, waiting by the goals for Creswell’s famous kicks that can travel over most of the pitch.</p><p>“Who’s the guy in the stands?” Regulus asked, “The one you… The one that spoke to you before the game.”</p><p>Sirius decided to ignore him, not wanting to talk about Remus with <em>him</em>. He kept running, hoping running would stop him from hitting Regulus in the face every time he opened his mouth.</p><p>“I mean, he doesn’t go here. How did you meet him?” Regulus sounded genuinely curious, albeit a little out of breath, as he jogged to keep up with Sirius.</p><p>On the other end of the pitch the ball stayed mostly in the same place, turning over to the other team consistently, but never making it far past the center line. Sirius thought about going over there to help, and then imagined the shit storm of insults James would rain down on him for leaving his post, and decided against it. He was needed here, even if here meant Regulus.</p><p>“Is he a friend of James’?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Sirius snapped.</p><p>Sirius was getting restless now; it was taking too long for them to bring the ball down here, and the longer it stayed up at their goals the higher risk there was of Slytherin scoring. Barty already looked like he was running slowly.</p><p>“I’m not going to…” Regulus trailed off.</p><p>“What?” Sirius turned to him finally. “What is it you want to ask me, really?”</p><p>Sirius could nearly see the cogs turning in his head, calculating what would be the best response, the most revealing but subtle, Sirius knew. Regulus always spoke when he knew his answers three steps ahead, knowing where the conversation will lead and how it’ll work to his advantage.</p><p>He could nearly get away with it, his computing mind hidden behind a soft face, if only he didn’t bite the inside of his cheek when he thought. That was his sign, and Sirius learned it long ago. He wasn’t interested in what Regulus had to say.</p><p>“Are you happy with the choice you’ve made?” Regulus asked softly.</p><p>The question caught him off guard, and couldn’t help but gaze over at Remus sitting nervously in the stands. There was no doubt when he replied, “<em>Duh</em>.”</p><p>Regulus nodded his head solemnly, suddenly focusing again as the ball flew over their way.</p><p>“Finally!” Sirius shouted as he charged to the ball and instantly took possession, dribbling it down toward the goals. Regulus matched him in speed easily, and Sirius suspected he only half-attempted to slip his feet in the way.</p><p>Sirius passed it over to Fabian, who kicked it to the goals and straight into Rosier’s hands. Rosier drop kicked the ball sending it over to the center line and into the opposition’s possession again.</p><p>Sirius could hear the violent swearing from James, and Madame Hooch’s warning that if he curses again she’ll kick him off the pitch.</p><p>“You’ll have to play better than that if you don’t want Mummy and Daddy-kins to disown you like they did me,” Sirius snarked at his brother.</p><p>The rest of the game continued in this pattern, the defense on both sides becoming dirtier as the clock ticked out. Regulus had started to elbow Sirius in the ribs to get in front of him, which Sirius was not averse to doing back.</p><p>His comment had not gone unheard, however, as Regulus pushed and fought for the ball when it came their way. It only brought Sirius greater satisfaction when he was able to break Regulus’ defenses, keeping the ball easily as he slipped it past his younger brother.</p><p>On the opposite end the Gryffindors in defense were getting agitated, unable to break through Slytherin’s offense. Sirius could see Peter was lagging in his reactions in the goal keep, and the rest of the team seemed to pick up on it too. Their blocking came in hard, knocking down the other players and clapping angrily whenever they kicked to throw them off.</p><p>Even from the distance, Sirius could see it was a considerable effort for James to not swear.</p><p>Neither side had scored since Sirius’ penalty at the beginning of the game, and the Slytherins were becoming desperate in their bid to score. With five minutes left to go they were charging through with new energy, making James pick up his swearing and shouting again. Madame Hooch ignored it this time, as the crowd started shouting deafeningly in the final minutes.</p><p>James shouted for all of them to come into defense, Sirius sprinting as soon as he heard the call and quickly losing Regulus in the sea of players.</p><p>James was still shouting instructions, but Sirius didn’t need to be listening to know what he saying. They almost had like a hive mind, Mrs Potter once told them, the way they knew what the other was thinking without saying a word. The aim was to keep Slytherin from scoring; they would be entirely in defense for the last two minutes of the game.</p><p>The blaring of the crowd seemed to keep them going, Sirius’ legs and arm aching from exertion, but determined to push on. They had to win, for the glory of beating Slytherin, but also for a promise. Thinking about it made his heart stutter and his legs feel weak, but he carried on.</p><p>Time felt like it was speeding up, as the crowd had started counting down from ten seconds to signal the end of the game. Sirius started laughing from victory, but James was still screaming as Goyle lined up in front of the goals, leg pulled back and ready to kick. Sirius watched in slow horror as Barty skidded in front, kicking his foot right into Goyle’s ankle.</p><p>The Slytherin stands instantly sounded in boos, and Hooch blew her whistle and called for a foul. Goyle was going to be given a penalty score.</p><p>James called for a time out, slinging his arm over Peter’s shoulders and muttering into his ear. Sirius walked to them, seeing Peter’s face pale as he approached.</p><p>“You’ll be right, mate,” Sirius told him, and the rest of the team had gathered around to pat Peter on the shoulder, giving him words of encouragement. Barty was rambling apologies, telling any player who would listen that he didn’t mean to kick Goyle, it was all a mistake, he was really very sorry.</p><p>“If you miss it,” James told him, “I’ll get Crouch to strip naked and run through the field. How about that?”</p><p>Peter let out a nervous laugh as the whistle blew to call them back.</p><p>“We don’t call you Penalty Pettigrew for nothing.” Gideon thumped him on the back.</p><p>“You <em>don’t</em> call me Penalty Pettigrew at all,” Peter squeaked.</p><p>The players all stood at the center line, watching from a distance. This would be the last play of the game.</p><p>Goyle took his place in front of the goals, looking as nervous as Peter standing in the lip of the goals. The pitch was silent, for the first time the crowd hushed and waiting.</p><p>Hooch blew her whistle again, indicating for Goyle to kick. Goyle took a few steps back and then charged at the ball, kicking it smoothly in the air.</p><p>Peter had to dive to save it, but expertly caught the ball to his chest, sending a wave of applause and bellowing to blow through the crowd.</p><p>Sirius started hooting, charging to Peter and jumping on his back excitedly. James and the rest of the team swallowed Peter too, screaming incoherently and tackling him to the ground.</p><p>The crowd from the Gryffindor stands spilled onto the field, collectively drowning all the players in streams of red and gold. Tissue paper rained down on them in colours of crimson, and Sirius didn’t know where they came from, but as he pulled himself off the mass of bodies suffocating Peter, he saw the gold shining in the air too. He watched them fall into the messy hair of a quiet boy, standing out as a beacon of nervousness among all the celebration. Sirius felt his heart pick up too.</p><p>“Congratulations,” Remus said when he approached him, smiling at the ground and kicking his feet at the grass absently. His hands were wedged securely in his pockets.</p><p>“Thank you,” Sirius replied, and before he could stop himself added, “You look good in gold.”</p><p>The paper squares had caught in his hood, which Remus now shook out and laughed bashfully. Sirius’ hands were glistening with sweat, anticipation driving through him as Remus finally looked up and slowly leaned in closer to press his warm lips to Sirius’. Their noses bumped into each other, causing Remus to giggle and open his mouth a little, but Sirius was frozen with his lips unmoving. He cherished the softness of Remus’ lips firm on his own, a spark of giddiness and excitement washing through him like a shudder.</p><p>He hadn’t realized he closed his eyes, but when he opened them he saw the most beautiful sight, Remus with his cheeks fully flushed and lips quirked in a coy grin, unable to stop the small fits of giggles bubbling through him. Sirius’ back felt uncomfortably hot, and his heart was racing to break his ribs, but his face splitting smile was stuck.</p><p>“Do you think your parents saw?” Remus asked jokingly, but Sirius leaned in again to press a quick but firm kiss to his lips again.</p><p>“Just in case they didn’t the first time.”</p><p>Remus lightly pecked him again and said, “Or the second.”</p><p>The crowd had started filling out of the pitch, making their way to the school to continue their celebrations there. Sirius’ teammates hit him on the back, asking him if he was coming too.</p><p>“Want to join in the after party?” He asked Remus.</p><p>Remus’ face fell instantly. “I’d love to, but I can’t. We told our parents we’d be home for dinner. They worry.”</p><p>He indicated roughly to his general being, an unplanned cough escaping his throat for emphasis.</p><p>“I get it,” Sirius said quickly. They were some of the last few people still on the grass, the Slytherin players and spectators leaving the pitch almost instantly.</p><p>“I’ll see you soon?” Remus sounded hopeful.</p><p>“Definitely,” Sirius said emphatically, “I seem to recall it’s someone’s birthday tomorrow.”</p><p>Remus groaned, but couldn’t stop the smile playing on his lips. “Nothing inappropriate.”</p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow, “Would birthday sex be considered inappropriate?”</p><p>Remus groaned again, burying his face in his hands. Sirius laughed at him.</p><p>“You definitely are a bastard,” Remus finally told him.</p><p>“I know,” Sirius agreed, “But that’s why you like me.”</p><p>Sirius expected a sarcastic answer, as usual with Remus when their conversations went like this, but Remus smiled and said, “Yeah.”</p><p>He slowly backed away, waving before turning and meeting Alice at the edge of the pitch, who was unashamedly watching their conversation. Sirius wondered what else she had watched, and if his parents had seen too.</p><p>He hoped so.</p><p>With the tingling memory of Remus’ lips on his own, his pulse still beating furiously, Sirius left the pitch to join the after party and celebrate his own victory.</p><p>*</p><p>(9:55) <em>I like your lips.</em></p><p>(9:55) <em>They go well with your hands.</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>You should see the rest of me.</strong></p><p>(9:56) <em>I expect I will.</em></p><p>(9:56) <em>I hope I do.</em></p><p>(9:58) <strong>Moony</strong></p><p>(9:58) <strong>Just you try and stop me.</strong></p>

To answer your earlier question, I don’t feel older at all.</em></p><p>(12:02) <strong>Impossible. It’s been… nearly three minutes, Moony, you should be hunched over with elderly bones.</strong></p><p>(12:03) <em>I’m hunched over with prolonged sitting and bad posture. Halfway there.</em></p><p>(12:03) <strong>I guess it’ll have to be good enough for now.

The weight of the world is heavy. It drowns me like a cloud raining down upon me endlessly, life seeming bleak, taxes coming out of my arse.</em></p><p>(9:25) <strong>Is this drama? Are you giving me drama?</strong></p><p>(9:26) <em>I’ve learned from the best, haven’t I?</em></p><p>(9:27) <strong>I’m honoured to have taught you, Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:28) <strong>So, what’d you get?</strong></p><p>(9:29) <em>A new set of lungs and laser vision.</em></p><p>(9:30) <strong>Not wings?</strong></p><p>(9:31) <em>Mum says they were all out.</em></p><p>(9:31) <strong>Bummer.</strong></p><p>(9:32) <em>I got a kindle because I have no more space on my bookshelf.</em></p><p>(9:32) <strong>Nerd.</strong></p><p>(9:33) <em>Be quiet.</em></p><p>(9:34) <em>Also thermal socks.</em></p><p>(9:34) <strong>SUCH A NERD.</strong></p><p>(9:35) <em>They’re patterned too.</em></p><p>(9:35) <strong>Only you would be pleased with socks as presents.</strong></p><p>(9:35) <em>My dad’s quite fond of them too.</em></p><p>(9:36) <strong>Ah, so being a nerd is hereditary?</strong></p><p>(9:37) <em>Apparently so. I also got a rubix cube, a telescope, some beakers, three calculators, and a retainer.</em></p><p>(9:37) <strong>Are you doing drama again??</strong></p><p>(9:38) <em>A little. But I did get a telescope. Tonks’ enthusiasm got me interested.</em></p><p>(9:39) <strong>Try and find me up there.</strong></p><p>(9:40) <em>Like you’re hard to miss.</em></p><p>(9:41) <strong>That’s either a compliment or an insult.</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>And I’m not sticking around long enough to let you know.</em></p><p>(9:45) <em>Going to the movies with my parents now.</em></p><p>(9:45) <em>See you later!</em></p><p>(9:47) <strong>Happy Birthday Moonstar!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

</p><p>(3:48) <em>Did you make that yourself?</em></p><p>(3:48) <strong>Nope!</strong></p><p>(3:49) <strong>Apparently I’m not the only one with the ingenuity of naming pets ‘Sheba’.</strong></p><p>(3:49) <em>That poor creature. I mean, no one cares much about goldfish, do they? But you tell someone you named your dog Sheba and they’d call it abuse…</em></p><p>(3:51) <strong>Moony, I can’t believe you. I give you solid evidence that the name Sheba is used by others and you diss it!</strong></p><p>(3:55) <em>How many other people are naming their pets Sheba, though, as a shortened version of Bathsheba?</em></p><p>(3:56) <strong>Aw, you remembered.</strong></p><p>(3:58) <em>‘Bathsheba’ sounds like some kind of Boogeyman my mother should have warned me about.</em></p><p>(3:58) <em>So of course I remembered it.</em></p><p>(3:58) <em>It’s ingrained into my nightmares.</em></p><p>(3:59) <strong>You’re a big boy now, Remus, I think it’s time I told you that</strong></p><p>(4:00) <strong>The Boogeyman is absolutely real and so is Santa.</strong></p><p>(4:03) <em>I always knew it. I knew my mother was lying about Santa. She just wanted the credit for herself.</em></p><p>(4:05) <strong>Exactly. Adults can’t be trusted, and you’re an adult now.</strong></p><p>(4:06) <strong>I don’t know if I can trust you anymore.</strong></p><p>(4:07) <em>Probably not. I’ll tell you we’re going to Disney Land and pull up at the vet’s instead.</em></p><p>(4:08) <strong>The cruelest betrayal. You cut deep, Moony.</strong></p><p>(4:10) <em>What are you doing at a pet store, anyway?</em></p><p>(4:10) <em>Oh God</em></p><p>(4:10) <em>You’re not getting me a fish, are you?</em></p><p>(4:11)<strong> ‘Course not.</strong></p><p>(4:11) <strong>Unless you’d like one.</strong></p><p>(4:12) <em>No more fish!</em></p><p>(4:15) <strong>I think Sheba could use a friend.</strong></p><p>(4:16) <em>Sheba has me.

I won’t get you another fish.</strong></p><p>(4:18) <em>Good.</em></p><p>(4:19) <em>You still haven’t answered the question, though.</em></p><p>(4:21) <strong>Do I need a reason to go into the pet store, Moony?</strong></p><p>(4:24) <em>I feel like the answer is yes.</em></p><p>(4:26) <strong>Well, you would be wrong.</strong></p><p>(4:27) <strong>Do you mean to tell me that you can just… walk right by a pet store?</strong></p><p>(4:28) <em>Uh? Yes?</em></p><p>(4:28) <strong>You mean you don’t go in to look at all the animals?</strong></p><p>(4:29) <em>We’ve established that animals don’t like me all that much.</em></p><p>(4:30) <strong>They're literally in cages! Glass boxes! Cruel treatment, if you ask me.</strong></p><p>(4:32) <em>So you went into the pet store just to look at the animals?</em></p><p>(4:33) <strong>… Yeah.</strong></p><p>(4:33) <strong>I had time to kill!</strong></p><p>(4:35) <em>Padfoot, you’re adorable.</em></p><p>(4:36) <strong>Puppies are adorable, Remus.</strong></p><p>(4:38) <em>You are the biggest puppy I know.</em></p><p>(4:39) <strong>So are you saying that if I was a puppy in a pet shop, you’d come in to see me?</strong></p><p>(4:40) <em>I might just have to.</em></p><p>(4:42) <strong>Good to know.</strong></p><p>(4:43) <strong>Gotta dash, Moony.

I feel like I have some authority on this.</strong></p><p>(6:01) <em>The authority of face analysis?</em></p><p>(6:02) <strong>The authority of having been in close proximity of said face and concluded</strong> <strong>that it looked old enough to kiss.</strong></p><p>(6:02) <em>Yes, I’m sure that was your thought process at the time.</em></p><p>(6:04) <strong>Ok, it was mostly just ‘shit shit shit.’</strong></p><p>(6:04) <em>Mine was ‘oh fuck.’</em></p><p>(6:05) <strong>How eloquent we are.</strong></p><p>(6:05) <em>Still made for a good end result, however.</em></p><p>(6:06) <strong>It did.</strong></p><p>(6:06) <em>I hope we get more end results like that.</em></p><p>(6:07) <strong>Me too.</strong></p><p>(6:08) <strong>I should go get some dinner.

</p><p>“<strong>Where did you go?</strong>”</p><p>“I had to take a break, Pads.”</p><p>“<strong>I need you!”</strong></p><p>“You don’t! You’ve already met the guy twice!”</p><p>“<strong>It’s not him I’m necessarily worried about this time!</strong>”</p><p>“Also, if I have to look at the back of your head one more time-”</p><p>“<strong>What if his friends don’t like me?</strong>”</p><p>“Holy fuck, Padfoot.”</p><p>“<strong>If I met me, I wouldn’t like me</strong>.”</p><p>“What? Don’t lie.”</p><p>“<strong>No, you’re right. I’m too handsome to not like</strong>.”</p><p>“You’ve already met Alice. She likes you!”</p><p>“<strong>It’s her boyfriend I’m worried about</strong>.”</p><p>“From what you’ve told me, he’s piss scared of you. And of Alice.”</p><p>“<strong>Small miracles</strong>.”</p><p>“You’ll be fine. Chill out, man.”</p><p>“<strong>Fine, yeah, I’m chill. When did you change your contact name on my phone?</strong>”</p><p>“I’ve changed it a few times. Which one is it this time?”</p><p>“<strong>Dude, how often do you change it?</strong>”</p><p>“Whenever you leave your phone lying around.”</p><p>“<strong>Oh my God, James</strong>.”</p><p>“Relax, I don’t go snooping through your super secret, ultra personal messages between you and a certain boy.”</p><p>“<strong>Come back to the dorm.</strong>”</p><p>“You’re not going to model another outfit in front of me, are you?”</p><p>“<strong>No, I’m going to beat the shit out of you</strong>.”</p><p>“…I’m gonna sneak into Lily’s dorm.”</p><p>“<strong>Potter!</strong>”</p><p>“Have a fun night, Sirius!”</p><p>
  <strong> <em>[Call Disconnected]</em> </strong>
</p><p>*</p><p>The first thing Alice said to him when he stepped out of his front door was, “Those shoes, you think?”</p><p>Remus prayed the blush to subside, waving his foot in front of him as if seeing it for the first time. The shoes were too big and made him look like a clown with his skinny legs, but he could see the appeal and the power in wearing them. The thick black boots made him feel like he could stand on God himself and crush his teeth.</p><p>“They were the first pair I could find,” he lied.</p><p>Alice studied the rest of his outfit, a small smile playing on her lips and a look in her eyes that Remus really didn’t like.</p><p>“What?” He grabbed the front of his jumper anxiously, tugging at the fabric.</p><p>“Nothing,” Alice replied, but her voice held a sweetness Remus was naturally suspicious of. “I like the pattern of your jumper. Come on, Frank is meeting us there. Move it.”</p><p>Walking in the boots was awkward, his heels dragging on the concrete behind them. A few times he nearly tripped, and from the corner of his eye he could see Alice stifling a laugh, but he pretended not to notice.</p><p>“Wish we’d caught a bus,” Alice complained after fifteen minutes of walking. She rubbed at her knees with the palm of her hand, massaging the muscles through the fabric of her jeans.</p><p>“We’re nearly there, right?” Remus glanced at his friend when she didn’t immediately reply, finding her tapping away on her phone. “Are you messaging Frank?”</p><p>“Hm?” Alice glanced up distractedly. “Sure. We’re nearly there.”</p><p>She slipped her phone into her pocket, dragging Remus hurriedly onto the cobbled streets of Diagon Alley, making a beeline for the ice cream parlour.</p><p>*</p><p>Finding a parking spot in Diagon Alley on a Tuesday evening shouldn’t have been this hard, Sirius thought. The place sure looked deserted, there were hardly any people milling around the shops as most of them were closing up for the day, and yet there persisted the presence of parked vehicles. Sirius circled the block again, glad that he left early, and prayed to find a place for his motorbike.</p><p>It wasn’t like his bike was that big in the first place. Automobile people were just annoying.</p><p>As an old man in a beaten pick up truck cut him off, swearing profusely out the window at him for “<em>getting in the goddamn way</em>,” Sirius amended that automobile people weren’t just annoying, they were <em>fucking</em> annoying.</p><p>But at least now there was a spot free, and he was at his leisure to sweat out his nervousness in the company of strangers until Remus turned up.</p><p>He wasn’t usually so bothered by other people. Talking to strangers was always an easy thing for him to do. But these were Remus’ friends. Important people.</p><p>Well, except maybe Frank, but he promised himself that he’d behave on that front. But only if Frank behaved first.</p><p>He reached the front of Zonko’s with ten minutes to spare, but couldn’t find another person hanging around. He bit his lip, unzipping his jacket pocket to pull out his phone.</p><p>(6:51) <strong>I’m here.</strong></p><p>(6:52) <strong><em><u>How punctual.</u></em></strong></p><p>Sirius snorted.</p><p>(6:52) <strong>Please, don’t sound so surprised</strong>.</p><p>(6:53) <strong><em><u>Sorry. You see the ice cream place across from Zonko’s?</u></em></strong></p><p>(6:54) <strong>You mean the place with the giant hand clutching a cone? Can’t miss it.</strong></p><p>(6:54<em>)</em><strong><em> <u>It’s art. But yes that place. Go in there. Find the group that’s got a girl with pink hair. That’s Tonks. We’ll be there soon</u></em></strong>.</p><p>(6:55) <strong>Ok. Should I hide under a table and shout SURPRISE when you guys come in?</strong></p><p>(6:56) <strong><em><u>If you want to.</u></em></strong></p><p>(6:56) <strong><em><u>But no one else will.</u></em></strong></p><p>(6:56) <strong>Right. See you soon then?</strong></p><p>(6:56) <strong><em><u>Yes now stop replying he’s suspicious.</u></em></strong></p><p>The parlour was one of the few places still with its lights on. Sirius couldn’t see anyone inside as he approached the door, slightly startled by the bell that chimed as he entered. He edged around the corner, unsure, until he saw a bobbing head of bubblegum pink hair sitting with two boys.</p><p>“Ah,” one of them said, “Are you Sirius?”</p><p>Sirius narrowed his eyes at the speaker, the boy with black, spirally hair, a smile stuck on his face as if it hurt him.</p><p><em>Frank</em>, Sirius knew immediately, and forced a smile onto his own face.</p><p>“Yep.” His voiced was strained as he edged over to the booth and plopped next to the girl. “You’re Tonks, right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” she smiled, “I think you might have heard me on the phone.”</p><p>Sirius nodded, his words failing him as a silence fell over them. The second boy said nothing, fiddling with the drawstring of his pants instead. Frank looked just as uncomfortable, shifting in his seat and not quite meeting Sirius’ deadly glare.</p><p>Sirius could be civil when Remus got there. For now, he’d have some fun.</p><p>Eventually, the dark boy cracked under Sirius’ gaze, stuttering out, “Uh, I’m Frank.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Sirius could see from the corner of his eye Tonks’ head shifting between the two of them, watching intently at the tense conversation.</p><p>Sirius wondered how long he’d have to stare at Frank before the guy started sweating.</p><p>“I, uh, understand that, um – maybe you’re not, er, entirely, uh, shit –”</p><p>“Geez, Frank,” the silent boy finally spoke, “Spit it out, dude.”</p><p>It was probably wrong how much he was enjoying this, but watching Frank nervously twitch at Sirius’ presence alone made him very satisfied. Sirius leaned back against his seat, crossing his arms over his chest and cocking an eyebrow at him. <em>What?</em></p><p>“I know you don’t like me,” Frank blundered through, “And I guess I understand –”</p><p>“You guess?” Sirius interjected coldly.</p><p>Frank huffed. “I’m sorry. It was a dick move.”</p><p>Sirius scoffed, but otherwise said nothing, letting the silence fall over them again. He wasn’t about to tell Frank that it was ok, or even thank him for apologising, so he just let it hang in the air.</p><p>Now, he promised, he would be civil.</p><p>*</p><p>When Remus realised where they were going, he said, “You’re not going to force feed me three plates of pancakes again, are you?”</p><p>But Alice was hardly paying attention. “Maybe not three.”</p><p>She kept walking forward, not glancing to see if Remus was following, striding into the ice cream parlour confidently. She held the door open for Remus, a satisfied smirk on her face, which instantly made Remus suspicious.</p><p>“What have you done?” He asked her, but she just laughed and continued to the back of the parlour.</p><p>The decor was set up to resemble a 50’s American diner, plastic red stools against the bar and booths slotted against the walls. The sparkling floor tiles were nearly blinding under the fluorescent lights, the walls plastered with framed photos of Elvis and Frank Sinatra, and an old – but still functioning – juke box sitting beside the register.</p><p>Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour had always been a favourite of Remus’, from the mouth-watering smell of apples pie that always seemed to cling to the place, to the fact that the pancakes were free, but only because it was Alice’s grandfather that owned the place.</p><p>Rounding the corner, Remus was met with a bombardment of glitter and streamers, a chorus of people shouting “<em>Happy Birthday!</em>”</p><p>Remus saw the group of people huddled in a booth as he waved the streamers from his vision, a small smile plastered on his face as he took in each of their faces.</p><p>His smile widened when he caught Sirius’ eye, the other boy winking at him.</p><p>“Oh,” said a quiet voice, “Is he here?”</p><p>Remus laughed as Frank’s voice replied, “Yes, Davey, he’s here.”</p><p>Remus spotted the small Chinese boy sitting between Frank and Tonks, his fingers tapping on the tabletop.</p><p>“Happy Birthday!” Davey shouted.</p><p>“Thanks,” Remus replied as he slid into the booth next to Sirius, who was, to Remus’ relief, sitting next to Tonks and well away from Frank.</p><p>Alice sat next to Frank, sitting opposite to Remus at the table, and shouted over her shoulder, “Grandpa! We’re all here!”</p><p>“So polite,” Remus said mildly. “So, Alice, how long have you known Tonks?”</p><p>“I don’t know Tonks. Hi!” Alice said excitedly, leaning over the table to grab Tonks’ hand, “I’m Alice!”</p><p>Tonks shook her hand enthusiastically, happily greeting her in return.</p><p>Remus furrowed his brows, biting his lower lip in confusion when Sirius said, “Ah, Alice kinda pulled a fast one on you.”</p><p>“No kidding,” Remus replied in slight disbelief, “I guess I shouldn’t bother asking how you’re here.”</p><p>“It was all in the name of birthday celebration,” Alice said hastily, “I don’t make it a habit to go through your things.”</p><p>“I hate to be that guy,” Davey cut in, “But do you think you could introduce me to the people I don’t know here?”</p><p>“Frank!” Alice said angrily.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How long were you sitting here with the three of them? And you didn’t introduce them to each other?”</p><p>Frank scratched his cheek, averting his gaze from Alice’s annoyed face. “It didn’t cross my mind.”</p><p>Remus heard Sirius scoff beside him, sending a kick to his shin to make him be quiet.</p><p>“I’m Sirius,” he offered instead of what Remus assumed would have been an insult aimed at Frank.</p><p>Davey frowned. “Where?”</p><p>“Uh…” Sirius said dumbfounded.</p><p>“Oh!” Davey smacked his hand to his forehead. “Sorry, dude. I can’t see you. I’m blind.”</p><p>Sirius deflated in relief as Tonks perked up, grabbing Davey’s hand and plopping it atop her pink hair.</p><p>“I’m Tonks,” she said, and then indicating for Sirius to lean forward, she put Davey’s hand on his head. “And this is Sirius. Remus is beside him.”</p><p>Davey smiled. “Wicked. Nice to meet you two. Sorry, this ‘not seeing’ thing is still kinda new.”</p><p>Frank rolled his eyes, clapping a hand on Davey’s shoulder. “You don’t have to keep apologising.”</p><p>Davey shrugged self consciously, tapping his fingers on the table again before saying, “Yeah, yeah. Gotta apologise one last time, though. Remus, your card might suck a bit.”</p><p>“You didn’t have to get me anything,” Remus said automatically as five feet all came kicking at him from under the table. “Ouch!”</p><p>“Well stop being an idiot,” Tonks said cheerily, “And open this!”</p><p>She threw a package onto Remus’ lap, wrapped haphazardly with a bow tied precariously around it. Remus untied the bow, peeling the sticky tape away carefully to preserve the paper, to reveal a collection of second-hand books. Sifting through the titles, Remus could distinguish a theme.</p><p>“<em>Revealing the Alien</em>,” he read to the table, “<em>The Truth About UFOs and Their Government Cover-up. E.T. meets Xenomorph</em>.”</p><p>Tonks laughed. “That last one is a fiction. Still think you might like it, though.”</p><p>Sirius plucked the book from his fingers, shuffling through the pages and pausing. “<em>She couldn’t believe her eyes</em>,” he read. “<em>There he was, silhouetted in her doorway and leaning casually, like he didn’t have a care in the universe. He crooked a finger at her seductively, beckoning her into his room. Xenomorph followed E.T. into the bedroom –</em>”</p><p>“Alright!” Remus snatched the book and slammed it shut. “Tonks, what’s with the alien books?”</p><p>“More importantly,” Davey said between fits of laughter, “Where can I find alien porn in audiobook?”</p><p>Sirius grinned wickedly, taking the book back from Remus. “I’ll make one for you, Davey. Seems interesting.”</p><p>Tonks looked over Sirius’ hunched figure to tell Remus, “I heard you got a telescope so I thought I’d start you early on the alien conspiracies. Make you a believer for when you see a UFO through your telescope.”</p><p>When Remus’ expression maintained incredulity, Tonks added, “Also, they’re funny as hell to read.”</p><p>“No kidding.” Remus could see the glistening in Sirius’ eyes as he cleared his throat. “<em>’Oh my!’ Xenomorph gasped. ‘You’re so big!’</em>” Sirius burst out laughing, his head colliding with the table so that he couldn’t keep reading.</p><p>Remus took the book back from Sirius’ slackened grip, scanning the page and muttering, “This is atrocious.” He paused to cough into arm and clear his throat. “<em>E.T. put a hand on her waist, his long fingers warm against her cold skin, sending a shudder up her knobbly spine. She wrapped her tail around his waist, snaking it over his torso until the tip could tickle under his chin. He kissed it –</em> I’m going to stop, this is awful.”</p><p>“This is a classic of our time,” Sirius giggled.</p><p>“This is someone’s published fanfiction,” Frank added.</p><p>“Kudos to them. It’s a work of art.”</p><p>Remus raised an eyebrow at Sirius, relieved but suspicious as to why he was being so civil to Frank. Sirius cocked his head in question under his gaze, but Remus shook his head, looking over Sirius instead to say, “Hey Tonks, you didn’t happen to write this yourself, did you?”</p><p>The table burst into laughter as Tonks spluttered, screeching that <em>no, she did not, don’t be so gross Remus!</em></p><p>Their laughter was interrupted by a sturdy old man approaching their table, arms laden in plates of pancakes, waffles, and slices of toast. Alice rose to help her grandfather with distributing plates around the table, and walking back with him to get jam, cream, chocolate sauce, and bowls of vanilla ice cream.</p><p>Florean Fortescue disappeared one last time, returning with a single ice cream cone in his hand with three scoops piled on top of each other, smiling benignly at the table. “And this one is for Tonks, who can’t have dairy.”</p><p>Tonks smiled brightly, reaching out for the cone and thanking Florean profusely.</p><p>“No need to thank me,” he said kindly, “Thank Jamie Oliver for his dairy-free recipes.” He winked at the table, waving off their thanks and gratitude humbly before returning to the kitchen.</p><p>“Honestly,” Frank said with a mound of waffles already shoved into his mouth, “I could marry that man’s waffles.”</p><p>“Guess you’ll just have to settle for his granddaughter,” Alice replied, plucking a strawberry from Frank’s plate.</p><p>Frank smiled at her and pecked her cheek. “That’s alright by me.”</p><p>Tonks cooed as Davey made gagging noises. Remus sighed, “Don’t be embarrassing.”</p><p>The parlour was nearly empty bar a mother and her child sitting near the door, eating ice cream from baby blue cups and not paying them one bit of attention.</p><p>“Like you can talk,” Alice retorted, eyes shifting between Remus and Sirius. Remus glared at her, or tried to, while Sirius laughed, throwing his arm over the back of Remus’ seat.</p><p>“We’re not embarrassing, are we, honey bunch?” Sirius joked.</p><p>Remus sighed again, but decided to play along. “Definitely not, sweetums.”</p><p>The dinner – or <em>brinner</em>, as Frank insisted it be called,<em> breakfast dinner</em> – was broken up by small bouts of chatter, too caught up in the delicious food to carry serious conversation.</p><p>Remus felt comforted by the warm thigh pressed to his, sometimes their elbows bumping into each other as they ate. A tapping on his foot indicated that Sirius was kicking his legs, like a child on a swing. One particular swing collided with Remus’ foot hard, Sirius ducking his head to look under the table and apologise until his voice caught – “Hang on, are those my shoes?”</p><p>“Oh,” Remus squeaked, a flush instantly spreading through his body and igniting him. He’d forgotten that he was wearing Sirius’ boots, and also looked down at his feet as if seeing the shoes for the first time.</p><p>Sirius laughed, speaking quietly so only Remus could hear him, “You’re a fucking dork.”</p><p>“You should stop leaving your stuff at my place then,” Remus said gruffly.</p><p>“Why on Earth would I do that?” He asked genuinely.</p><p>Remus considered it, and then shrugged. “Maybe you shouldn’t, then.”</p><p>Sirius smirked, satisfied. “It’s a barter system, though. Can’t be all take.”</p><p>“What would you like, then?” Remus backtracked, “Be tame.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, stuffing a piece of pancake in his mouth as he thought. He chewed slowly, hand stroking his chin in exaggerated thinking, and it took Remus scuffing him over the head to finally get a reply.</p><p>“I like your jumper,” Sirius said, “It’s an interesting choice.”</p><p>“That’s what Alice said,” Remus replied, eyebrows knit in confusion. He looked down at his figure, tracing the print on his jumper with his finger. “I don’t get why you both think that.”</p><p>“Moony,” Sirius said plainly.</p><p>Remus’ fingers stilled, a disgruntled groan escaping his throat as he realised he was wearing a jumper with the lunar cycle printed on it.</p><p>“This wasn’t a conscious decision,” he promised. Sirius nodded sympathetically.</p><p>“I’m sure, Moony.”</p><p>“It really wasn’t.”</p><p>“If you insist.”</p><p>“Really –”</p><p>But he was cut off by an exclamation from Davey, waving one hand in the air as the other searched through his bag and pulled out an envelope. Remus’ name was printed on the front with careful, albeit slightly wobbly letters.</p><p>“Your card, dude,” Davey said off-handedly, but his legs were bouncing so hard that the whole booth was shaking.</p><p>Remus opened the envelope carefully, sliding the card out as another slip of paper fell onto his lap. He read the card first, Davey’s precise scrawl clearly legible.</p><p>
  <em>Happy Birthday, Remus.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sorry I won’t be able to see it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Haha, disability jokes, up top dude.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Seriously, happy 18<sup>th</sup>. Have fun.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Davey Gudgeon.</em>
</p><p>Remus laughed abruptly, a small smile curving on Davey’s face at the sound.</p><p>“Up top, Davey,” Remus said. Davey turned his hand palm up on the table so Remus could lean over to high five it, both of them bursting into giggles.</p><p>“We’re going to need an explanation,” Alice said, taking the card and reading it herself.</p><p>“The first time Davey spoke to me, he could still see,” Remus began the story.</p><p>“I’d seen Remus around the hospital, in like the canteen and stuff, and he was always hooked up to an oxygen tank, but we’d never spoken,” Davey added.</p><p>“When we do finally run into each other it’s when I’ve accidentally stumbled into the taxi bay, not really paying attention to where I was going. Davey was waiting for his parents to arrive when he turns to me and says –”</p><p>“<em>’Hey, do you want a smoke?</em>’ I swear, if looks could kill, Remus would have had me murdered the first time we met for that comment alone.”</p><p>“Ah,” Remus said with understanding, “I guess that’s why you were so surprised by my response.”</p><p>Davey laughed. “Yeah, dude. I say, ‘<em>Hey, do you want a smoke?</em>’ And after the most terrifying silence of my life, this guy replies, ‘<em>I can’t b-reathe you just said that to me.</em>’”</p><p>Alice groaned and smacked her head onto the table, Frank patting her back sympathetically, while Tonks and Sirius roared with laughter.</p><p>“Davey looked stunned for a moment,” Remus continued, “Until he just shouted at my face, ‘<em>Disability jokes! Up top, dude!</em>’”</p><p>Davey was grinning broadly, not faltering when Tonks asked, “How did you become blind? If you don’t mind me asking.”</p><p>“Wanking too much,” Frank quickly cut over him, earning himself a careless slap from Davey.</p><p>“I have type 1 Neurofibromatosis, which caused glaucoma,” Davey replied, “Damage to the optic nerve meant I lost my vision gradually.”</p><p>“That’s a mouthful,” Tonks said idly and Davey laughed in agreement.</p><p>Remus’ laughter was caught in his throat, lodged behind a ball of phlegm. He tried to cough into his napkin discreetly, but the hacking reverberated around the now empty parlour. He slid out from the seat.</p><p>“Sorry,” he rasped, “Just give me a second.”</p><p>He went outside, gasping in the fresh air in short bursts before coughing, as loud and as heavy as he needed to evict the phlegm. He slid down the wall, inhaling deeply now that his body had allowed him to breathe.</p><p>“Are you ok?” The concerned voice filled the chill of the night air, drawing Remus’ attention back to the present. He had zoned out, his tired body making his vision blurred and brain fuzzy. He looked up at Sirius, hovering nervously over him, hands running through his shaggy hair.</p><p>“Yeah, fine,” Remus managed. “Just needed some fresh air. Sorry for ditching you.”</p><p>Sirius shrugged, but his shoulders were tense. “That’s fine. As you can see, I’ve followed you like a lost puppy.”</p><p>“I told you, you were a puppy.”</p><p>“Do, uh…” He bit his lip. “Do you need any help?”</p><p>Remus couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped his throat. “No, Padfoot. Relax. I’m just gonna sit out here for a bit.”</p><p>“Ok. I’ll sit with you.”</p><p>Sirius fell gracefully beside him, his legs kicking out in front of him, feet tapping against Remus’. Remus allowed himself a small smile, shuffling a little closer to the boy beside him so their shoulders touched.</p><p>Silence fell over them as they gazed up at the night sky, but it was not uncomfortable. So many times Remus had worried that they would run out of things to say that he didn’t consider how their silence could be just as rewarding.</p><p>When he felt Sirius shuffling beside him, however, a thought struck him. A thought that already made his cheeks bleed crimson, and a wavering of conscience that made him hesitate.</p><p>Remus cleared his throat, croaking out “Padfoot –” just as Sirius had turned to say, “Remus –”</p><p>They both laughed, Sirius dragging his hand over his face. “You go first,” he said.</p><p>“No, I don’t know if I want mine answered. You go first.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, um. I just wanted to know…” Sirius was now rubbing the back of his neck vigorously, so vigorously that Remus was worried he’d tear skin off. “Because we said when we’d meet we’d… uh, but, if you still don’t that’s ok too…”</p><p>“Padfoot, get to the point.”</p><p>Sirius pouted. “You’re not gentle.”</p><p>“Get it over with.”</p><p>Remus could see the considerable effort it took Sirius to turn to him, to look him in the eye. Remus felt pinned, unable to look away, and was suddenly very worried about what Sirius was going to ask. He let out a shaky breath, just as Sirius did the same.</p><p>“Moony, are you my boyfriend?”</p><p>The nervous edge to his voice made Remus smile. Never in a million years did Remus think he could make someone this nervous, could make someone actually have to ask him this question, and especially not someone like Sirius Black, who exuded confidence and nonchalance that it made those around him feel stronger too.</p><p>Never in a million years, Remus thought, and yet he couldn’t help but tease the poor boy. “Are you asking me if I am or if I will be?”</p><p>Sirius huffed, a strand of hair falling over his face caught in the up-breeze. “Why are you being difficult?”</p><p>Remus shrugged, a smirk still playing on his lips. “Payback for something, probably.”</p><p>“Ugh, fine, you’re gonna make me say it.”</p><p>Remus looked at him, amused, waiting for Sirius to crack. He looked very put out, like Remus was making him confess some horrible secret, but the corner of his mouth twitched as he asked, “Moony, will you be my boyfriend?”</p><p>Remus tapped a finger on his chin, looking back up at the sky in faux contemplation. “I’ll think about it.”</p><p>The silence that fell made Remus look back quickly, watching Sirius’ face frown. Remus waved his hands hastily. “I’m kidding! Of course, Sirius.”</p><p>Sirius let out a laugh. “That was a cruel joke.”</p><p>Remus tried hard not to laugh too, instead muttering out a sorry.</p><p>“Now you have to say it.”</p><p>“What?” Remus furrowed his brows in genuine confusion.</p><p>“Say the word, Moony. You know what I’m talking about!”</p><p>Remus groaned. “You’re horrible.”</p><p>“Just do it.” Sirius’ face was painted with amusement, enjoying watching Remus squirm uncomfortably as his face grew hot.</p><p>Not even the cool night air could fan off the rising heat in his cheeks as Remus replied, “Yes, Padfoot, I will be your… boyfriend.”</p><p>Sirius whooped - <em>honest-to-God-whooped</em>, Remus thought, horrified - causing the owls settled into the tree tops to take flight, their silhouettes flapping against the full moon hung in the sky like a stage prop. Remus buried his face in his hands, saving himself the embarrassment of Sirius seeing his tomato red face, but Sirius didn’t seem bothered. He slung an arm around Remus’ shoulders, pulling him in close and patting him. Remus wasn’t entirely sure, but he thought he heard Sirius murmur, <em>you’re too cute</em>.</p><p>Sirius didn’t move his arm when Remus finally emerged from the sanctuary of his hands, instead stating, “I have another question.”</p><p>Remus wanted to retreat back into his hands, instead choking out, “Oh, God – Ok.”</p><p>Sirius cleared his throat theatrically, straightening his back against the brick wall. “Will you go out on a date with me this Saturday to further solidify your position as my boyfriend?”</p><p>“Prongs won’t have you running laps?” Remus asked.</p><p>“We don’t have a game this week. He’s letting us off.”</p><p>“Then I would love to go on a date with you to… Further solidify my position as your boyfriend. Do I get paid for it?”</p><p>Sirius smirked impishly. “You can get paid in kisses.”</p><p>“Oh. I was hoping hard cash.”</p><p>“Well, sorry to disappoint,” Sirius scoffed.</p><p>“I guess it’ll do just fine.” Remus paused. “Can I exchange the kisses for a gift card?”</p><p>Sirius groaned, dropping his head into his free hand. “Moony, I’m already regretting my decision.”</p><p>Remus laughed, poking him in the side and singing it’s too late until Sirius started laughing too, their bodies shaking together in whispered giggles.</p><p>“So what was your question?” Sirius asked once their laughter had subsided.</p><p>Remus desperately tried to feign ignorance. “My question?”</p><p>“You were gonna ask me something before I rudely interrupted with talk of boyfriends.”</p><p>Remus shrugged. “Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“Moony.” Sirius’ voice was exasperated, but he rolled his eyes playfully and shook Remus’ figure gently.</p><p>“I just… No, it’s a stupid question. Forget it.” He coughed into the back of his hand, trying not to look Sirius in the eye.</p><p>“Oh, come on.”</p><p>“I wanted to know if…” He broke off into mumbles, holding his hand over his mouth.</p><p>Sirius smirked. “I didn’t quite catch that.”</p><p>Remus groaned, dragging a hand over his face. He kept his hand covering his eyes, refusing to look at Sirius, refusing to look at anything as he asked, “Was it… was it fireworks?”</p><p>In the darkness behind his eyelids, Remus heard a shy laugh, and an answer that set his heart racing.</p><p>“Remus, it was an explosion.”</p><p>Remus tried to contain the stupidly wide grin that was forming on his face, but against all protests it persisted, his cheeks hurting from the intensity of it. Sirius laughed again, and Remus felt a peck on his cheek.</p><p>Remus finally removed his hands from his face, greeted with Sirius’ brilliant smile. His whole face shone beautifully under the moonlight, a glow emitting from his very being, like something from a dream. This was definitely a dream, Remus thought as he reached out to touch him, gentle fingers stroking the side of his face and tracing his jaw. Sirius ducked his head shyly, but then leaned forward to press their lips together, warm despite the coolness of the night.</p><p>If Remus were being honest, he’d admit that he’d been warm for a while now.</p><p>He could feel Sirius’ shaky exhales against his cheek, could feel Sirius’ nose bumping into his, could feel Sirius’ hand cradle his face as he slowly kissed him. He was suddenly so aware of every inch of Sirius, the brush of his hair against Remus’ forehead, his knee pressed against Remus’ thigh, but especially his lips.</p><p>Remus was especially aware when those lips drew back and pecked lightly on the tip of his nose, the cold air rushing in where Sirius’ face used to be.</p><p>“I forgot, I have something for you,” Sirius murmured. “Since we’re doing the all the embarrassing stuff in one go, it seems.”</p><p>Remus hummed in agreement, processing Sirius’ words too late. “Wait, something for me –”</p><p>Sirius sighed in exaggeration. “Yes, Moony, considering this is your birthday get together and all. Here.”</p><p>Sirius held out a small box, a single white bow stuck onto the lid. He snatched his hands away as soon as Remus grabbed it, slotting it between his thighs and jiggling his legs nervously.</p><p>Remus opened the lid, peering in to see a pair of dog tags resting against a plush cushion, one of them turned up to read ‘<em>Moony</em>’.</p><p>Carefully, Remus lifted the chain from the box, the tags clinking together and flashing shiny silver in the night light. He pinched the second tag between his fingers and read ‘<em>Padfoot</em>’.</p><p>“It’s kinda…” Sirius trailed off, coughing nervously. “Uh, sappy.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Remus agreed, “But I like it.” He slipped the chain over his head, the tags resting comfortably on his sternum.</p><p>“Oh,” Sirius said, “Good. Great.”</p><p>Remus coughed thickly into his hand, making him realise just how cold it was out there. They should head back inside into the warmth, he thought, if he didn’t want to catch a cold – or worse.</p><p>He stood, holding a hand out to pull Sirius up with him. Sirius took it, dusting the seat of his pants off with his other hand and standing close to Remus.</p><p>“Thanks,” Remus said.</p><p>Sirius tried to shrug casually. “No problem. Happy Birthday.”</p><p>Remus smiled bashfully, tugging at the front of Sirius’ shirt to follow him back inside.</p><p>"Wait," Sirius halted. He dug into his jeans pocket, pulling out his phone and flashing Remus a grin. "Take a picture with me, Birthday Boy."</p><p>"Oh, no," Remus groaned, but he didn't protest as Sirius pulled him to his side.</p><p>"Say cheese!"</p><p>The flash in Remus' eyes hurt, blinking out star lights and rubbing his eyes furiously. He could hardly see the picture when Sirius showed him, but told him to send it to him anyway.</p><p>"Already done," Sirius told him as they walked back into the parlour.</p><p>Remus hastily tucked the dog tags into the inside of his jumper as Alice exclaimed at their approach, starting up a jagged chorus of <em>Happy Birthday</em> and moving aside to reveal a chocolate cake lit up with eighteen candles.</p><p>Remus groaned, hiding his face in his hands as his friends continued singing, Sirius singing loudest of them all and right in Remus’ ear.</p><p>He was glad when it was over, praying that he had enough breath to blow out the candles in one go, his fears voiced by Davey with a smirk, “Need a hand, buddy?”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Remus replied gently, taking as deep a breath as he could and blowing out the candles.</p><p>“Oh, no!” Frank exclaimed, and urged on by Davey added, “He missed one.”</p><p>Remus gave a final huff to blow out the persistent remaining candle, mumbling how candles for him was, “like going bowling.”</p><p>“Gotta cut the cake now,” Tonks said, handing him a large carving knife. Remus took it from her gingerly, wondering who on Earth gave Tonks the knife to hold.</p><p>Remus was cutting into the first layer as Alice said, “If you hit the bottom, you have to kiss the closest boy.”</p><p>“What?” Remus asked distractedly, feeling the tip of the blade hit the plate beneath the cake. “Ah.”</p><p>“You hit the bottom, didn't you?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Pucker up, Lover Boy.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>“Oh,” Sirius said surprised, “That’s me. Right.”</p><p>“Right,” Alice mimicked, a Cheshire grin spread on her face.</p><p>Remus raised the knife and pointed it Alice. “Don’t make me use this,” he warned.</p><p>Alice stuck her tongue out at him as Tonks said, “Rules are rules!” Alice gently took the knife from his hand, placing it on the table and shoving him in Sirius’ direction.</p><p>Remus faced him, about to grumble a quick apology when his face was roughly pulled into a kiss, making a surprised <em>hmph!</em> against Sirius’ mouth.</p><p>Remus could vaguely hear hollering from his friends, the blood rushing in his ears overpowering their calls and all too soon Sirius’ lips were gone from his again.</p><p>Remus nearly refused a slice of the chocolate cake, if it meant keeping the tingling feeling of Sirius’ lips on his.</p><p>*</p><p>Alice had been the one who suggested it and Sirius nearly smacked himself on the face for not thinking of it first. Of course, it would be a great idea. Whether Remus saw it that way or not was another thing.</p><p>Sirius immediately knew that Remus indeed did not think it was a great idea.</p><p>“Definitely not,” he squeaked, edging away from him nervously.</p><p>There was only the glow of the streetlights to illuminate them, the night practically dead from inactivity. Sirius couldn’t see or hear anyone else in the street, and his vehicle was resting lonely, only Florean’s old hatchback for company.</p><p>“It’ll be fine,” Sirius drawled, “Do you trust me?”</p><p>“With my life?” Remus looked skeptical. “Not as much as you think.”</p><p>Sirius frowned. “You’re thinking of the broken arm again, aren’t you?”</p><p>Remus nodded emphatically, twisting his hands together nervously. Alice watched him from the sidewalk, tittering under her breath.</p><p>“Well, I’ve got no room in the car for you,” she told him. “It’s either that or you can walk home.”</p><p>“This was a trap!” Remus’ voice raised several octaves, his face scandalized as both Sirius and Alice just calmly nodded.</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>Sirius handed a helmet to Remus, only slightly nervous as Remus turned it over in his hands, a small look of bewilderment stuck on his face.</p><p>The helmet was painted grey, a wash of tones blending together to make it look dirty, bumpy, black spots painted as craters. It was a full moon, much like the one slipping behind clouds in the sky, with the word ‘<em>MOONY’</em> printed in block letters at the nape.</p><p>“So you can be assured,” Sirius said, “That in the event that I do crash, your noggin will be protected.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes, but slipped the motorbike helmet over his head, his face disappearing behind the black visor.</p><p>“Great,” came his muffled voice, “Now I’m from Daft Punk.”</p><p>“Are you up all night to get lucky?” Sirius asked, only laughing when Remus punched him weakly in the arm.</p><p>“We’re going now!” Alice called. “See ya!”</p><p>Sirius and Remus waved them off as they climbed into the car, Tonks and Davey squished into the backseat with Frank.</p><p>When the headlights turned the corner and disappeared, Sirius turned to Remus, a determined grin on his face. “Ready to go?”</p><p>Remus lifted the visor, peering at Sirius in the darkness. He looked worried, Sirius noted, chewing on his bottom lip, but also resolved, glaring at the motorbike as if he could beat it in a fight.</p><p>“Fine,” he sighed. “Let’s get this over with.”</p><p>Sirius clapped Remus’ visor back down. “I’m going to need a better attitude than that.”</p><p>“I’ll have a better attitude when I’m sure you won’t kill me.”</p><p>Sirius looked thoughtful. “That’s fair enough,” he allowed, and pulled on his own helmet and hoisting a leg over the bike. He flicked the kill switch on, turning the key in the ignition and watching the warning lights flash on and off again, everything as it should be.</p><p>He was about to push the start button when he realised that Remus hadn’t followed him on yet. Lifting his visor, he looked over his shoulder to see Remus still standing anxiously by the bike.</p><p>“Ok,” Remus said after a deep breath, “Don’t laugh, but how the fuck do I get on that thing?”</p><p>Sirius can’t help the laugh that escaped his throat and he could practically feel Remus’ unimpressed expression under the helmet.</p><p>“It’s gonna be a bit awkward getting on,” Sirius said and Remus huffed. “You have to lift a leg over, as if you were getting on a horse.”</p><p>“Christ.”</p><p>“Come on, I’ll give you hand.”</p><p>Sirius flexed his hand at Remus, who took it delicately in one hand, his other hand resting on Sirius’ shoulder and using it to lift his weight over the bike. He landed ungracefully behind Sirius, his hands instantly clutching Sirius’ shoulders to steady himself. When Remus was sturdy, his lifted his hands, hovering them nervously in the air, unsure where to grab Sirius.</p><p>Sirius didn’t think laughing would earn him any points, so instead reached behind him to grab Remus’ arms, wrapping them around his waist and feeling his heart catch in his throat at the contact. He could feel Remus’ chest pressed against him, could feel his heart beating frantically against his back.</p><p>“It’ll be ok,” Sirius told him, trying to disguise the shaking in his hands. “I’ll go slow.”</p><p>Remus nodded, the chin of his helmet resting on Sirius’ shoulder as he peered over.</p><p>Sirius pressed the start button, the engine igniting instantly much to his relief. He didn’t think a stalling engine would instill confidence in his ability to drive Remus home safely.</p><p>He kicked the flip stand up, twisting his wrist down and accelerating slowly, Elvendork’s loud churning spilling into the otherwise silent night. Remus’ hold on Sirius tightened as they took off, knees pressed solidly into his thighs and his helmet clacking against Sirius’.</p><p>“You alright?” Sirius had to shout, competing with the engine and the layer of helmet clamped over Remus’ ears.</p><p>“Getting there,” Remus shouted back. Sirius could feel his body start to relax against his, his hands no longer in a death grip on his waist.</p><p>The motorbike was practically crawling at an impossibly low speed for Sirius’ liking. The trip between Diagon Alley and Remus’ house was only a ten minute drive, but at the pace they were going it would take them nearly double that time.</p><p>When Sirius realised this meant that he would have Remus pressed against him for a longer duration, he decided that the slow pace wasn’t all that bad.</p><p>They were a few houses down from Remus’ house when Sirius felt a tapping on his shoulder, glancing to see Remus indicating for him to pull over. He did, this time without knocking down any neighbours’ wheelie bins, and flicked the ignition off so Remus could clamber off.</p><p>His hair was matted to his head when he took the helmet off. Sirius reached out to run a hand through it before he could stop himself, surprising them both as he ruffled Remus’ hair back into place.</p><p>Remus held the helmet out awkwardly, intending for Sirius to take it back. Sirius waved him off, flipping the visor so he could speak.</p><p>“That one’s yours, now,” he said breezily.</p><p>“Oh.” Remus added as an afterthought, “You should take these back, though.”</p><p>He sat on the pavement and tugged off the large boots, slipping them off his feet easily.</p><p>“Don’t wanna keep them as a souvenir?”</p><p>“They don’t fit.” He tied the boots together by the laces, swinging them over the handle bar on Elvendork.</p><p>“You know what they say about big feet,” Sirius said with a grin. Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Thank you for the ride home. Also the helmet. Also the dog tags. Also for coming tonight.” Remus paused, shifting his weight onto either foot and worrying at his lower lip.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“I can’t reach your lips with the helmet on so I’m just going to do this,” and he pecked the tip of Sirius’ nose before turning down the street and walking home in his argyle socks.</p><p>“Good night,” Sirius shouted to his retreating back, “Happy Birthday!”</p><p>He could hear Remus’ breathy laugh like a chime in the wind, and watched him until he turned onto his lawn, disappearing from Sirius’ line of sight.</p><p>Sirius idled on the road for a few more minutes, a harmonious laugh replaying over in his ears and a grin splitting his face.</p><p>*</p><p>(11:39) <strong>So I had a good night.</strong></p><p>(11:40) <em>Me too. Sometimes Alice does good things.</em></p><p>(11:40) <strong>Except Frank.</strong></p><p>(11:41) <em>Padfoot!</em></p><p>(11:41) <em>You said he wasn’t that bad.</em></p><p>(11:43) <strong>Yeah but.

But I guess you’re welcome.</strong></p><p>(11:55) <em>I think Alice appreciated it too.</em></p><p>(11:56) <strong>You’re lucky I at least like Alice. I like your other friends, too</strong>.</p><p>(11:58) <em>And not me?</em></p><p>(11:58) <strong>I’m undecided. You’re ok sometimes I guess.</strong></p><p>(11:59) <em>Sometimes. I’ll take that.</em></p><p>(11:59) <strong>You’re too easily pleased</strong>.</p><p>(12:01) <em>Sorry I mean shower me in romance.</em></p><p>(12:04) <strong>Moony, you are the light of my life and without you I would be drowning in darkness.</strong></p><p>(12:05) <em>I said romantic not poetic.</em></p><p>(12:05)<strong> Is that not the same thing, my love?</strong></p><p>(12:07) <em>Needs more flowers.</em></p><p>(12:09) <strong>I’ll keep that in mind</strong>.</p><p>(12:10) <em>Good night, dearest.</em></p><p>(12:11) <strong>Good night, darling.

  <u>Saturday PM</u>
</p><p>(3:42) <strong>We still good for tonight?</strong></p><p>(3:43) <em>Yes. I will be there at eight outside of the Three Broomsticks.</em></p><p>(3:45) <strong>Good, excellent. It’s just, it wouldn’t be plans if we didn’t obsess over meeting times.</strong></p><p>(3:46) <em>Of course. I’ll check in a few hours if you’re still able to make it.</em></p><p>(3:47) <strong>I appreciate it.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(6:12) <em>So are you still able to make it tonight?</em></p><p>(6:13) <strong>Wow, I didn’t think you’d actually do it.</strong></p><p>(6:15) <em>You doubted my sarcasm?</em></p><p>(6:16) <strong>I doubted your dedication to the joke.</strong></p><p>(6:19) <em>I’m very dedicated. Now answer the question.</em></p><p>(6:21) <strong>Yes, I am still able to make it tonight.</strong></p><p>(6:22) <strong>I will pick you up at the Three Broomsticks at eight.</strong></p><p>(6:25) <em>I appreciate it.</em></p><p>*</p><p>The road looked like it had been slicked with orange oil under Sirius’ headlights. The early evening’s downpour coated the tarmac, reflecting brightly under the streetlights and the glittering stars. Sirius could feel spots of rain dance on the back of his hands and he was glad that he decided to wear his leather jacket.</p><p>He hoped Remus wore an appropriate jacket, but considering the boy probably lived in at least three layers of sweaters at all times, Sirius was assured he’d be ok.</p><p>His stomach bubbled with excitement. Sirius had planned this for a long time, longer than he cared to admit, detailing the perfect date to bring Remus out on. He was quite impressed with himself, would have been one of those things he’d brag about if it didn’t mean eternal ribbing from Prongs and Wormtail.</p><p>Remus, he was absolutely sure, would be impressed. And in awe. And also probably mortified that Sirius remembered, but he counted on that the most.</p><p>This meant he could not be late. Not at all. Glancing quickly at his watch he read he had ten minutes to reach the Three Broomsticks, if he wanted to be absolutely punctual.</p><p>Sirius definitely wanted to be absolutely punctual.</p><p>He saw them before he heard them, the sheen on the road becoming coated in red, coated in blue, as flashing lights followed him and a siren sounded for him to pull over, and Sirius mildly wondered how much trouble he’d be in if he flipped the bird at police officers.</p><p>With a disgruntled sigh, Sirius pulled over the motorbike, his annoyance giving away to anxiety when he realised that he had just been pulled over by cops on his illegal bike.</p><p><em>Shit,</em> he thought.</p><p>“Shit,” he muttered under his breath, as the driver’s door opened and out stepped an intimidatingly large figure. It limped toward him, favouring its right leg, and stopping beside him with a pen and notepad in hand.</p><p>“You,” the officer said, and Sirius had to crane his neck to look at his face. “I’m Officer Moody. Can I see yer license? Also, lift this thing up,” he indicated to Sirius’ helmet.</p><p>Sirius took off his helmet, shaking his hair loose into his face and rummaging through his back pocket for his wallet.</p><p>He thanked the Lord for Barty Crouch Junior’s dodgy connections for getting him this fake license.</p><p>Sirius cursed the Lord for making him forget it at his dorm.</p><p>“Shit,” he muttered again, only this time Officer Moody heard him.</p><p>The officer grunted. “Do you even have a license, son?”</p><p>“Uh,” Sirius stammered, finally looking into the terrifying gaze of the officer. Sirius was shocked to find a mismatched pair of eyes, one almost black and the other piercing blue, both staring down at him and pinning him to the spot. Sirius swallowed thickly.</p><p>“Thought you’d just nick this piece of machine and take it for a joy ride? Thought that’d be funny, huh?” Moody pressed.</p><p>“What!” Sirius gripped the handles of Elvendork tightly, “This is my bike! I <em>made</em> it!”</p><p>Moody raised an eyebrow, his blue eye bulging out alarmingly. “You made it, you say?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah,” Sirius replied unsure. “From scraps and stuff. Whatever I could scavenge.”</p><p>Moody gave a low whistle, closing his notepad and slotting it into his back pocket.</p><p>“Look,” he said regrettably, “I have to bring you in because you don’t have a license. And I’m not condoning law breaking! Don’t do this again!” He barked this at Sirius so aggressively that Sirius startled, clutching at his chest. “But I’ve got to bring you int’er the station. Call your parents to come get you. But I won’t charge you with anythin’.”</p><p>But Sirius could already feel the colour draining from his face, his blood running cold. “M-my parents? Can you call someone else?”</p><p>Moody grabbed him by the shoulder, effortlessly dragging him off the bike and slapping his back roughly. “As long as they’re overage,” he grunted.</p><p>Sirius calmed instantly, almost missing Moody tell him that someone will come collect his bike later and that it would be kept in the police garage as a repossessed vehicle.</p><p>“Repossessed?” Sirius squawked as he was dragged to the patrol car. “Does that mean I’m not getting it back? Also,” he added, “Aren’t you going to read my rights or whatever.”</p><p>Moody snorted. “You have the right to shut your trap, son. You’re not technically being arrested. You want the bike back, you better turn up to the police auction.”</p><p>Sirius slid into the backseat of the car, Moody slamming the door shut behind him. He groaned, dropping his head into his hands.</p><p>Trust him to get arrested on his first date with Remus.</p><p>*</p><p>Remus was trying very hard not to be nervous. He’d met with Sirius three times now, had been alone with him one time before, and yet the butterflies in his stomach persisted. He hoped they weren’t going out for food. He didn’t know if he’d be able to keep it down.</p><p>A shiver passed down his spine, and pulling his cardigan tighter around his slender frame checked his phone for the umpteenth time.</p><p>(8:06)</p><p>Six minutes late wasn’t really that late, was it? He thought about that first time they tried to meet, Sirius waiting for an hour while Remus was thrown around the house gathering clothes and toiletries, preparing for a trip he didn’t want to go on. Sirius’ anxiety must have been one hundred times worse than whatever Remus was feeling now, but the thought only brought him guilt instead of comfort.</p><p>The fact was Sirius called this a <em>date</em>. An actual date because they were actually together. It all still sounded so surreal.</p><p>But surprisingly to Remus, it didn’t feel different. Things were more or less the same, only now they saw each other more frequently, got to talk face to face.</p><p>Didn’t mean he’d have to stop texting him, though.</p><p>(8:12) <em>I’m here, by the way. As promised</em>.</p><p>Remus wondered if the text sounded anxious. <em>Fuck it</em>, he thought, he was anxious. Sirius had also said it was a surprise. A surprise date was even worse than a regular date, not that Remus had ever been on one.</p><p>(8:30) <em>I’d appreciate it if you were here, too.</em></p><p>(8:31) <em>No rush or anything.</em></p><p>Sirius waited for him for an hour that first time, Remus reminded himself. Today he could wait two.</p><p>Another chill spread through his body, droplets of water plinking on his nose. Maybe one and a half hours.</p><p>He nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket, snatching it quickly and nearly dropping in on the pavement in his haste.</p><p>
  <strong> <em>[Caller ID Unknown]</em> </strong>
</p><p>Remus frowned, but answered the call anyway.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>An automative voice answered him. “You are receiving a call from Hogsmeade Police Station. Do you wish to accept this call?”</p><p>Remus blinked. “What the fuck? Oh. Uh, ok.”</p><p>The line clicked before an exuberant voice burst in his ear, “Moony!”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Remus repeated.</p><p>“Uh, yeah,” Sirius’ tinny phone voice sounded sheepish. “Small problem.”</p><p>“Is it?” Remus asked incredulously. “Is it really a small problem? I mean, I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but by the sounds of things you’ve been arrested.”</p><p>Remus could practically hear the shrug. “I’m officially a punk delinquent.”</p><p>Remus sighed, pinching the bridge of nose between his index and thumb. “What did you do?” He asked wearily.</p><p>“Elvendork has been confiscated.”</p><p>“Oh, the illegal bike. Of course. Well, at least you didn’t kill someone, I guess.”</p><p>“I love that you’re seeing the upside to this. Are you still at the meeting spot?”</p><p>Remus snorted. “My arse has been rooted here for a solid hour, yes.”</p><p>“Shit.” Sirius sounded guilty. “I’m really sorry, Remus.”</p><p>“I don’t think I get to complain,” Remus laughed, “I mean, you literally just got arrested.”</p><p>“Kinda. But speaking of, do you think you could possibly bail me out?”</p><p>Remus was taken aback. “Me?”</p><p>“I… Don’t want to cause trouble for the Potters. Also, you’re over eighteen, so it’s cool.”</p><p>Remus breathed a sigh of relief, a small cough escaping in his exhale. “So, you’re not going to jail?”</p><p>“Nope. I’ll tell you the regaling tale once you come get me?” He sounded hopeful, almost as if he expected Remus to say no, so Remus couldn’t help but tease him.</p><p>“There’s a part of me that wants to leave you there.”</p><p>“Moony!” He shouted and Remus laughed.</p><p>“I’m kidding. Alright, I’m coming to get your sorry arse.”</p><p>“My knight in shining armour,” he cooed.</p><p>“Fucking damsel,” Remus muttered, and hung up the phone.</p><p>*</p><p>Remus was very glad that Hogsmeade was a small town. It meant getting to the police station only took a few minutes of walking, and before he knew it he was facing the drab station front, the doors automatic and checkered blue and white.</p><p>He entered slowly, edging past the empty plastic chairs with suspicious stains on them. There was only one officer at the front desk, not even looking up as Remus approached, instead scribbling away at a file and scratching distractedly at her head.</p><p>Remus tapped nervously at the front desk to get the officer’s attention, making note of her name tag. <em>Officer Hestia Jones.</em></p><p>He cleared his throat finally, coughing a little as he croaked, “I’m here to bail out… Uh, Sirius Black?”</p><p>Jones didn’t bother looking up. “Your name?”</p><p>“Remus Lupin.”</p><p>She jabbed her hand out to him, fingers flicking impatiently. Remus quickly pulled out his I.D., slotting it between her fingers. She glanced over it, noting down the serial number into her file before giving it back.</p><p>“Can I ask for your relationship with the detained?”</p><p>Remus stalled. “Uh…”</p><p>Jones finally looked up at him, listing off with her fingers, “Relative, friend, partner –”</p><p>“B-boyfriend,” Remus tripped over the word. “He’s actually gotten arrested on our first date,” he added.</p><p>“He sounds like a keeper,” she drawled. She stood up suddenly, still scratching at her head. “Come this way, please.”</p><p>Remus followed behind Jones, his feet whispering against the linoleum floor. He heard a deep murmuring voice bouncing off the yellowing walls, echoing down to them as incomprehensible words. The reply however was clearer, a bark of laughter Remus already knew too well, followed by an excited jumbled of jargon that Remus probably would have to Google to understand.</p><p>When they reach the cell containing Sirius, Remus found him talking animatedly with a large, intimidating policeman, who watched Sirius gesticulate with scrutiny but genuine interest.</p><p>Remus nearly tripped over his own feet. He knew that policeman.</p><p>“Moony!” Sirius exclaimed, instantly bowing his head in embarrassment. “Uh, Remus. Hello.”</p><p>“Hello,” Remus replied distractedly, still staring at the policeman.</p><p>If Remus thought it possible, he would have said that Moody was surprised to see him. “Lupin,” he said.</p><p>“Hello, sir,” Remus greeted meekly.</p><p>“Didn’t expect to see you here,” Moody replied, confirming Remus’ suspicion.</p><p>“Honestly,” Remus breathed, “I didn't expect to be here.”</p><p>“Hang on,” Sirius interjected, “You two know each other?”</p><p>“We’re neighbours,” Moody said.</p><p>But Remus could hardly hear the exchange anymore. The reality of what was happening finally came crashing down on him, watching Sirius slouch casually inside the holding cell as if he lived there with a cracked ceramic toilet bowl not a metre away from him. Remus didn’t realise he was laughing at first, silent heaves stuck in his throat, but then there were tears streaming down his face and the best he could do to save the situation was to clamp one hand over his mouth, the other clutching at his stomach.</p><p>“Glad to see the two of you are taking this so seriously,” Moody grumbled.</p><p>“I’m always serious, sir,” Sirius snorted before turning to Remus. “You alright, love?”</p><p>Remus shook his head, wiping tears from his face as the last of his laughter subsided to giggles.</p><p>“I’m opening it up now,” Jones informed them, her keys jangling from her hip.</p><p>Remus bit back the ‘<em>do you have to?</em>’, thinking that he should probably at least look like he was taking this more seriously. He was the adult of the two, after all.</p><p>Jones slid open the barred door, informing Sirius that he was free to go and handing him over the plastic bag of his personal possessions. He smiled brightly at her, walking confidently to Remus and pecking him on the cheek.</p><p>“Hello,” he said again.</p><p>“You’re the worst,” Remus replied vehemently before sighing. “Come on, before you commit another offence.”</p><p>Moody and Jones walked them out of the station, Moody giving Sirius a stern warning that next time he won’t be so lenient.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Sirius saluted. “Thanks, Mad Eye!”</p><p>Remus wanted to slap his hands over Sirius’ mouth, horrified by what it was spewing out. He was surprised to hear Moody chuckle lightly, muttering about him being an <em>arrogant little bugger</em> as he turned back into the station.</p><p>“You have a death wish,” Remus gasped as Sirius laughed mischievously.</p><p>“Moody’s cool,” he said, slipping his hand easily into Remus’.</p><p>“Moody once attacked my cat because it kept going near his canaries.”</p><p>This time Sirius gasped. “What?”</p><p>“Well,” Remus considered, “Not really attacked. He threw a slipper at it.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, “Somehow that’s even better.”</p><p>The concrete beneath their feet was pitted with puddles, their legs weaving in and out, bodies diverging and coming back together to avoid them like they were doing a little dance. They were halfway down the street when Remus turned to ask Sirius where they were going, only to be cut off by another gasp.</p><p>“What?” Remus asked instead.</p><p>“I’m sorry!” Sirius exclaimed. “I promised I’d be your ride.”</p><p>Remus tried to wave him off, snorting that it was all right. Sirius let go of his hand and moved in front of him, crouching with his arms braced behind him.</p><p>“Hop on,” he said.</p><p>“No,” Remus automatically replied, horrified.</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius insisted.</p><p>“You’re not fucking piggy backing me.”</p><p>“I most certainly fucking am,” Sirius challenged, “Or would you rather bridal style?”</p><p>“I’d rather keep my feet on the ground, thank you very much.”</p><p>Sirius looked over his shoulder, cocking an eyebrow. “I will tackle you,” he warned.</p><p>“No you won’t,” Remus said confidently, crossing his arms over his chest. He coughed lightly. “I’m sick.”</p><p>“Boo, you whore,” Sirius quoted. “You can’t pull the sick card when it suits you.”</p><p>Remus feigned indignance. “Can and will.”</p><p>“If you’re so sick then how come you’re able to do so much walking?”</p><p>“Determination,” Remus said airily, “To prove you wrong.”</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius’ voice suddenly turned stern. Remus wanted to argue, to insist that he wasn’t made of glass, but Sirius’ pleading eyes turned him to liquid.</p><p>Remus groaned, muttering <em>fine, fine fine</em>, and climbing onto Sirius’ back. Sirius exalted in joy, bouncing Remus gently and continuing on their way down the street.</p><p>Remus was glad that it was so dark, but being a Saturday night meant that there were a few people milling around the street.</p><p>He hid his face in the crook of Sirius’ neck when a car of people started whistling at them, Sirius loftily giving them the finger. Sirius smelled spicy, his hair also tickling Remus’ nose that it was impossible to stop the small sneeze that he barely contained in the palm of his hand.</p><p>“You sneeze like a kitten,” Sirius told him and without waiting for a retort continued, “So, I had a plan to take you somewhere specific.”</p><p>“Oh, really?” Remus asked sarcastically. Sirius pretended to drop him, causing Remus to frantically find purchase to hold on and gripping tightly on Sirius’ shoulders.</p><p>“But we can’t get there without transport.”</p><p>Remus couldn’t help the roll of his eyes. “Ever heard of a bus?”</p><p>But Sirius was off in his own world, mostly talking to himself when he said, “Also, it’s already pretty late. Damn it.”</p><p>“Where were we going?” Remus asked.</p><p>Sirius smirked impishly. “Still not telling. It’ll be a surprise next time, I guess.”</p><p>“Aw, Padfoot! Come on.” Remus poked him in the cheek. “I hate surprises.”</p><p>“I know, that’s kinda why I’m keeping it a secret.”</p><p>Remus pouted. “You’re a bastard.”</p><p>Sirius turned the street corner, heading back to Diagon Alley.</p><p>“Yep. So, here’s the new plan.”</p><p>The shop lights glittered like stars, and Remus decided that it didn’t matter what the original plan Sirius had in store. Whatever this one would be was good too.</p><p>Didn’t stop him from urging Sirius on, another poke aimed at his cheek. “Yeah? I’m listening.”</p><p>The cobblestone of Diagon Alley gave way to smooth concrete as Sirius stepped over a nature strip, walking confidently through a car park.</p><p>“This is it,” he told Remus.</p><p>“You’re kidding,” Remus said flatly.</p><p>The restaurant – and Remus used that term loosely – was surprisingly full for the time of night. The workers behind the counter bustled about hurriedly, filling orders and handing over paper bags. The place was brightly lit, hurting Remus’ eyes after so long in the dark street.</p><p>“I know someone who’s working right now,” Sirius said. “Funnily enough, her surname is Macdonald.”</p><p>Remus could only image the torment of having the name Macdonald while working at its most famous namesake.</p><p>“Why are you –” Remus paused as they passed under the golden arches, continuing on in the car park. “Sirius, you’re going the wrong way.”</p><p>“No, I’m not.”</p><p>“The front door was over there. This is the –”</p><p>“Hello,” a tired voice greeted them from the drive through window, “Can I take your – oh, for fuck’s sake.”</p><p>The McDonald’s worker looked at them angrily, glaring at Sirius in particular with a scowl on her face. Her long black hair was pulled into a plait down her back, a red cap and microphone fixed securely on her head. Sirius grinned broadly at her.</p><p>“Hello, Mary. Looking as gorgeous as ever.”</p><p>“Bite me, Black,” Mary spat. “What the hell is this?”</p><p>“This,” Sirius hoisted Remus a little higher on his back, “Is Remus. And that’s a rather rude way to refer to him as. You call this customer service?”</p><p>Mary clacked a bubble between her lips. “No, this is a drive through. You know, for vehicles! I can’t serve you!”</p><p>Sirius faced Remus, craning his neck to look at him. “Remus, this is Mary, and she’s very mean.”</p><p>“Hello, Mary,” Remus said politely, slightly worried that she would call her manager on them.</p><p>“Remus would like half a dozen nuggets and medium fries, Mary,” Sirius ordered. “Also –”</p><p>“I hope you get hit by a car,” Mary interjected. “Not you, Remus. Just Sirius.”</p><p>Remus smiled. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Aaaaand, I’d like a Big Mac,” Sirius said as if he hadn’t been interrupted. “Please?”</p><p>Mary gazed at him haughtily, popping another bubble and swirling her tongue to collect the gum.</p><p>“Oh my God, Sirius, just take us inside,” Remus pleaded.</p><p>Mary groaned exaggeratedly, bashing buttons into the register carelessly. “Fine, whatever, I’ll ring it up.”</p><p>Sirius lit up. “Mary, you’re a queen.”</p><p>“I fucking better be,” she said pointedly, “I have to deal with idiots like you all night.”</p><p>“Yeah, but you like me.”</p><p>She snorted. “Hardly. Would you like fries with your Big Mac?”</p><p>Sirius couldn’t suppress his laughter. “Did you… Did you just ask if I’d like fries with that?”</p><p>“I’m going to kick your arse, Sirius Black,” she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“I’d love fries,” Sirius said amicably, “Also a chocolate milkshake for Moo- Uh, Remus.”</p><p>“Moo-Remus,” he muttered into Sirius’ ear, “Fantastic.” Sirius shushed him.</p><p>“Go to the other window already,” Mary whined, “Tell them I said it was ok.”</p><p>“Thanks, Mary!” Sirius said cheerily, skipping down the drive through.</p><p>“Sorry, Mary!” Remus shouted, waving to her over his shoulder. She waved back lazily, and before turning around the corner Remus swore he saw her smirk.</p><p>*</p><p>Sirius took them to the botanical gardens, insisting that he continue carrying Remus even when trudging up a steep and rain-slicked hill.</p><p>He nearly dropped him half a dozen times, Remus giving a slight squeak each time, but eventually they reached the top. They had an overreaching view of Hogsmeade, the town below flashing delicately like jewels in a black ocean. It looked like an oil painting, the rain and mist a thumb smudging out the lights.</p><p>“So, what do you want to be when you grow up, Moony?”</p><p>Sirius’ voice startled him out of his day dream, turning away from the view to watch as the boy draped his leather jacket out on the dewy grass. The trees overhead managed to keep most of the rain from falling to the ground, but it was still slightly damp.</p><p>“’When I grow up’?” Remus mimicked. “I’m already, technically, an adult. Before you, might I add.”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. “Yes, you’ve mentioned that. But you know what I mean.”</p><p>He sat down on one side of the jacket and placed their bags of food beside him. He tapped the empty space for Remus to join him.</p><p>“How would I like to best contribute to capitalist society through my goods and serviced?” Remus asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Sirius ruffled through the bag, pulling out the packet of fries and stuffing a few into his mouth. “You’re such a cynic, Moony.” Bits of potato came spitting out of his mouth.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Remus answered and sat beside him. “What do you want to do?”</p><p>Sirius gave a non-committal shrug. “I’m not sure yet. I like building and making things.”</p><p>“Like Elvendork.” Remus searched for his own food, only just realising how long it had been since he’d eaten.</p><p>“Like Elvendork, may they rest in peace.”</p><p>“This might sound like the obvious answer,” Remus said slowly, “but what about a mechanic?”</p><p>“That is the obvious answer,” Sirius scoffed.</p><p>“Can’t you let me dream for oil and overalls?” Remus joked, but it was Sirius’ suggestive smirk that made his face hot.</p><p>He expected Sirius to keep ribbing him, but he said instead, “Building a robot would be cool.”</p><p>“Like those battle robots?”</p><p>“Not what I meant, but that would be cool too. Yeah,” he said wistfully, “That’s really cool.”</p><p>“I think I’m sorry I suggested it.” Remus took a long drink from his milkshake. “So, like, mechanical engineering?”</p><p>“Maybe.” Sirius tapped his chin. “I don’t know. I should probably start looking at courses.”</p><p>“Probably!” Remus spluttered.</p><p>“Well, have you started?” He shot back.</p><p>Remus’ voice was high when he said, “You really think I could go to university?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>“I couldn’t even do high school.”</p><p>“That’s because high school is shit,” he promised him, “Trust me, you dodged a bullet.”</p><p>“I don't know…” Remus trailed off, fiddling with the dog tags slung around his neck. Sirius grabbed one of his hands, rubbing it gently with his fingers.</p><p>“Moony,” Sirius whispered earnestly, “What do you want to do?”</p><p>“I’d like to be a teacher.” Remus paused. “See the problem?”</p><p>“No?” Sirius replied sincerely.</p><p>Remus couldn’t look at him. He told the grass, “I couldn’t even attend high school, so how am I going to teach at one?”</p><p>Remus could feel Sirius' shrug tug his arm. “I don’t know. But you’ll figure it out when you get there. You can be a substitute teacher, work the days you can and don’t on the days you can’t.”</p><p>“You make it sound like it’ll be easy,” he said irritably.</p><p>“Of course it won’t be easy. Doesn't mean you quit. You’re worrying about things that haven’t even happened yet, and won’t happen for a long time.”</p><p>Remus finally looked up to meet Sirius’ kind gaze, finding the determination and confidence that Remus lacked. He smiled shyly.</p><p>“Thanks, Sirius,” he said quietly.</p><p>Sirius nodded in assent. He continued to gently massage Remus’ hand, impossibly warm despite the cold weather.</p><p>“I reckon you’d be a great teacher,” Sirius said after a long pause. “You’re always telling me when I’m wrong.”</p><p>Remus grinned. “Like when you say ‘reckon’ and I have to tell you that it isn’t considered to be a formal word?”</p><p>“If I can speak it, it’s real,” he declared petulantly.</p><p>Remus laughed lightly and fell onto his back, tugging at Sirius’ hand to lie down with him. His head rested on the springy grass, but he didn’t mind so much as long as he got to look up at the stars above them.</p><p>“Does that apply to mythical creatures, too?” Remus asked.</p><p>He heard Sirius make a thoughtful sound beside him, rolling onto his side to look down at Remus. “I’ll let you know when I ride a hippogriff.”</p><p>They stayed like that for a moment until Sirius leaned closer, his hair falling over Remus’ face before he could reach his lips. Remus giggled slightly, tucking the strands behind Sirius’ ear and cradling the back of his head, fingers tangled in his hair. Remus pulled him closer, meeting him in a chaste kiss that quickly became heated. Sirius’ lips were sliding against his, sucking at his bottom lip briefly as his body drew in closer, the pair nearly chest to chest.</p><p>“Oh…” Sirius sighed, and Remus thought it was some kind of funny moan until he continued, “Oh, no.”</p><p>Remus opened his eyes. “What?”</p><p>“I’ve put – Oh, gross!” Sirius rolled over further onto Remus’ lying figure so that he was completely on top of him, holding up his arm. “I’ve put my elbow in your chips!”</p><p>“Oh, Padfoot, not my chips!” Remus admonished.</p><p>“They were cold anyway, ok? Also, not good for you.”</p><p>Their noses were nearly brushing, Sirius’ hair falling out from behind his ear again and causing a curtain around their faces.</p><p>“I seem to recall an entire box of donuts you consumed – mm!” Sirius captured his mouth in another kiss, retracting a few moments later. “Oi!”</p><p>“Stop proving me wrong,” Sirius said, but he didn’t sound like he meant it.</p><p>Remus played along. “How else will I get kissed, then?”</p><p>“Asking nicely.”</p><p>“Sirius, I – I can’t,” Remus started laughing uncontrollably, “Oh my God, you smell like potatoes.”</p><p>“Moony!” Sirius buried his face in Remus’ shaking chest, groaning as Remus patted his head sympathetically.</p><p>Remus felt a shock in his back pocket. “Oh, I’m vibrating.”</p><p>Sirius looked up. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Shove over, my phone’s in my back pocket.” He pushed Sirius’ shoulder, but Sirius didn’t budge. “You’re not moving.”</p><p>Sirius smirked down at him. “Nope.”</p><p>“Arsehole,” Remus sighed. He lifted his hips from the ground to reach into his back pocket, pressing impossibly closer to Sirius so that their hips bumped. He lit up his screen, hoping the light didn’t show how red his face had become, and read the caller ID. “It’s my mum.”</p><p>“I won’t say anything inappropriate.”</p><p>“I don’t believe you – shut up!” Sirius started laughing, whispering Remus’ name into his ear. Remus shushed him before answering the phone, keeping a hand pressed over Sirius’ mouth.</p><p>After a few <em>uh huh’</em>s and <em>sorry</em>’s and <em>yes mum</em>’s, Remus hung up. “I’ve gotta go home. Apparently it’s midnight.”</p><p>“Oh, shit. Ok. I’ll walk you home.” Sirius lifted himself off the ground, shaking grass from his hair and holding out a hand to help Remus up.</p><p>“Actually walking this time, please,” Remus asked.</p><p>Sirius shrugged, slinging an arm over his shoulders. “Your loss, really.”</p><p>*</p><p>The walk home was comfortably silent. The only sounds they could hear was the distant laughter of late-night party goers, random cars doing skids, and the sound of smashing glass that told Remus was most likely a robbery.</p><p>“How are you getting home?” Remus asked as they turned into his street, feeling very selfish for not having asked sooner.</p><p>“I messaged Mrs Potter. Told her I caught the bus here. She should be – ah, there she is.” He waved to the car approaching, headlights blinking at them in greeting. Sirius turned back to him. “Hey, I’m sorry I fucked up our date.”</p><p>“You didn’t fuck it up.”</p><p>“I got arrested,” Sirius said plainly.</p><p>“A minor set back.”</p><p>“You had to bail me out of jail,” he insisted, but Remus just laughed.</p><p>“Well, it makes for an interesting story. I think I want to be there when you have to tell James and Peter, honestly.”</p><p>Sirius groaned. “James is gonna go mental. That’s not gonna be pretty.” He buried his face in his hands, grounding the palm of his hand into his eyes.</p><p>Remus laughed again, poking him in the shoulder to get his attention. “You really didn’t fuck it up. It was a good night.”</p><p>“It was, once I got out of a cell,” Sirius’ muffled voice came through his hands. He peeked through his fingers. “Good night, Remus.”</p><p>Remus smiled, kissing him one last time and startling back as a car horn beeped at them excitedly.</p><p>“’Night,” Remus laughed, watching Sirius’ face disappear again behind his hands.</p><p>“Yep,” he answered. “Good night.”</p><p>“Good night,” Remus said again.</p><p>“G– Hey, don’t do that.”</p><p>Remus stood on the footpath, waving as the car drove by him and both Mrs Potter and Sirius waved back, a broad and satisfied grin on both of their faces.</p><p>Remus walked the remaining two houses to his home, imagining the smile on his face looked just the same.</p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Sunday AM</u>
</p><p>(10:44) <em>I told my mum about you.</em></p><p>(10:46) <strong>Oh, really?

Thanks, Sirius.</em></p><p>(11:01) <em>Mum said that it did explain some things.</em></p><p>(11:03) <strong>Things?</strong></p><p>(11:03) <em>She said she thought I was reading a lot of humour articles on my phone.</em></p><p>(11:04) <strong>Awww</strong></p><p>(11:04) <strong>Did you tell her I’m better than any humour article?</strong></p><p>(11:05) <em>She’s been asking me this whole time what’s so funny whenever I laugh</em></p><p>(11:05) <em>She said she got suspicious when I refused to tell her.</em></p><p>(11:06) <strong>You’re the worst liar.</strong></p><p>(11:08) <em>I am.

Don’t be messing with my motherfucking clique.</p><p>(1:59) <strong>I am your clique!</strong></p><p>(2:00) Not anymore.

</p><p>(10:25) <strong>Remember when I called Wormtail a blabbermouth?</strong></p><p>(10:28) <em>Apparently I didn’t remember it the first time, but I got it the second time around.</em></p><p>(10:30) <strong>My history class has just been informed that I got arrested on the weekend.</strong></p><p>(10:32) <em>Ah. Not good?</em></p><p>(10:34) <strong>It’s kinda funny, actually</strong></p><p>(10:34) <strong>He told them I ran over an old lady.</strong></p><p>(10:36) <em>That’s not funny, Pads, that’s manslaughter.</em></p><p>(10:38) <strong>People believe it, though.</strong></p><p>(10:38) <strong>Ha, a new game has started.</strong></p><p>(10:39) <em>I don't like the sound of this.</em></p><p>(10:40) <strong>Who can tell the most outlandish lie for my arrest and have people believe it?</strong></p><p>(10:42) <em>I’m betting Peter will win.</em></p><p>(10:43) <strong>Why Peter?</strong></p><p>(10:43) <em>His artistic flair.</em></p><p>(10:44) <strong>Haha, he’ll be happy to hear that.</strong></p><p>(10:45) <strong>But it’s also maybe not good.</strong></p><p>(10:46) <em>Won’t it add to your punk rock cred?</em></p><p>(10:48) <strong>Yeah, but it’ll also reach some big ears.</strong></p><p>(10:51) <em>Relatives?</em></p><p>(10:55) <strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p>(10:55) <strong>I don’t think my parents will do anything now but…</strong></p><p>(10:56) <em>Still better if they didn’t know.</em></p><p>(10:57) <strong>Mm. I guess we’ll see how it goes.</strong></p><p>(10:58) <em>You’ve got people to bail you out if you need it, Sirius.</em></p><p>(10:59) <strong>Thanks Moony</strong></p><p>(10:59) <strong>Was that a jail joke?</strong></p><p>(11:02) <em>Oops.

Don’t underestimate me.</strong></p><p>(11:33) <em>May the best punner win, then.</em></p><p>(11:34) <strong>I plun to.</strong></p><p>(11:35) <em>That was a reach.</em></p><p>(11:36) <strong>Punt up.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>

</p><p>(3:17) <strong>Oh! They arrived earlier than I thought. Cool.</strong></p><p>(3:18) <em>Padfoot, why have you done this.</em></p><p>(3:19) <strong>Thank you! For bailing me out of jail! Also, sorry! That you had to bail me out of jail and ruined our night!</strong></p><p>(3:20)<em> I told you, you didn’t.</em></p><p>(3:21) <strong>Now, I’m gonna need a visual on how bright your cheeks are right now.</strong></p><p>(3:23) <em>You’re cruel! I’m pretty sure I’ve said this before!</em></p><p>(3:23) <strong>It’s also Spring, Moony! The season of flowers!</strong></p><p>(3:25) <em>My mother has put them in a vase.</em></p><p>(3:27) <strong>Good. They’d look nice on your desk, next to Sheba. Liven up their environment.</strong></p><p>(3:30) <em>Ok, there. That’s where I’ve put them</em>.</p><p>(3:31) <strong>Good. Hope the chocolates were to your liking, also.</strong></p><p>(3:33) <em>I can’t believe – yes, Padfoot.</em></p><p>(3:33) <em>Thank you.</em></p><p>(3:33) <em>Even though it wasn’t necessary.</em></p><p>(3:35) <strong>It was absolutely necessary.</strong></p><p>(3:36) <strong>The mental image of you burying your face in your hands is all I ever need in life, to be honest with you Moons</strong>.</p><p>(3:36) <em>You’re so gross.</em></p><p>(3:37) <strong>So are you.</strong></p><p>(3:38) <em>Dad is very intrigued by these flowers.</em></p><p>(3:40) <strong>A fan of lilies, is he?</strong></p><p>(3:41) <em>I didn’t even notice. You sent me lilies? Your friend is literally named Lily.</em></p><p>(3:45) <strong>That’s the point. We don’t ever buy any other kinds of flowers now. It annoys her.</strong></p><p>(3:46) <em>You definitely are a bastard.</em></p><p>(3:47) <strong>A bastard who sent you lilies and chocolate!</strong></p><p>(3:50) <em>No, if asked, these flowers and chocolates came from a distant relative on my mum’s side.</em></p><p>(3:53) <strong>Oo, I can do that.</strong></p><p>(3:53)<strong> I can play the role of distant relative.</strong></p><p>(3:54) <strong>What should my name be? I have a distant relative named Alphard, maybe I could go by that.</strong></p><p>(3:55) <em>That’s not necessary.</em></p><p>(3:58) <strong>What’s my backstory? Why haven’t I made contact until now?</strong></p><p>(3:58) <strong>Oh shit, look at the time. James is gonna kill me. Crunch time for training again, I’ll talk to later, my distant nephew!</strong></p><p>(4:00) <em>Send me money next time, uncle.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(6:32) <em>So your name is Alphard, you’re my second-great-uncle thrice removed who only just discovered that I existed. You have no spouse, no children, nor a telephone. You like your privacy and the sentimentality of hand written letters. You farm llamas and in your spare time you like to knit from their wool. Next time, you’re going to send me a sweater.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(7:26) <strong>Remus, I know for a fact that you don’t need any more sweaters.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(8:03) <em>One can never have too many sweaters.</em></p><p>(8:03) <em>Also, I’m glad that was your only issue with the back story.</em></p><p>(8:06) <strong>Llamas sound cool. I’ll have to brush up on my llama farming knowledge, though.</strong></p><p>(8:09) <em>Only if you decide I’m going to inherit the business when you die.</em></p><p>(8:11) <strong>I’ll remember to write it into my will.</strong></p><p>(8:13) <em>We only just discovered each other and you’re already writing me into your will?</em></p><p>(8:15) <strong>What can I say, you have a strong influence.</strong></p><p>(8:15) <strong>You seem like a reliable enough young man to take over my farm.</strong></p><p>(8:16) <em>I don't know the first thing about farming.</em></p><p>(8:19) <strong>I’ll teach you, nephew, don't worry.</strong></p><p>(8:23) <em>I’m telling my mum about your new role.</em></p><p>(8:23) <em>She likes your commitment. Thinks it’s very amusing.</em></p><p>(8:25) <strong>She just needs to wait and see what else I can do.</strong></p><p>(8:28) <em>I’m a little scared to ask what you mean.</em></p><p>(8:29) <strong>;-)</strong></p><p>(8:30) <em>I told you, no emoticons.</em></p><p>(8:33) <strong>But it keeps me mysterious.</strong></p><p>(8:34) <em>You’re already my estranged uncle, how much more mystery do you need.</em></p><p>(8:35) <strong>More. More mystery.</strong></p><p>(8:37) <strong>Why aren’t I married?</strong></p><p>(8:39) <em>To stay dedicated to the farm, of course.</em></p><p>(8:40)<strong> Wow, I must really love these llamas.</strong></p><p>(8:41) <em>And knitting. Don’t forget your knitting.</em></p><p>(8:45) <strong>Don’t fret, Remus, you’ll get your damn sweater.</strong></p><p>(8:47) <em>Just making sure.</em></p><p>(8:50) <strong>I must assist Wormtail with his History essay. He’s nearly crying.</strong></p><p>(8:51) <em>History makes me cry too, only for different reasons.</em></p><p>(8:54) <strong>?</strong></p><p>(8:55) <em>You’re doing French revolution, right? Marie Antoinette didn’t deserve this</em>.</p><p>(8:56) <strong>Can I quote that in Wormy’s essay? I’ll source you.</strong></p><p>(8:58) <em>If it helps his argument, go right ahead.</em></p><p>(8:59) <strong>Cheers, Moony. I’ll talk to you later.</strong></p><p>(9:00) <em>Have fun essay writing.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(10:03) <em>Good night, Sirius.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(11:43) <strong>Good night, Moony.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Tuesday AM</u>
</p><p>(8:03) <em>Did you honestly to go bed at midnight?</em></p><p>(8:05) <strong>Essay writing is hard work.

This is for your benefit, after all.</em></p><p>(9:17) <u>Haha, stupid prick got in trouble trying to chew me out.</u></p><p>(9:17) <u>Changed my mind, this is fun.</u></p><p>*</p><p>(9:19) <strong>Taaaalk to meeeee</strong></p><p>(9:20) <em>Can you confirm Peter’s status of alive?</em></p><p>(9:21) <strong>Yeah, the little rat’s breathing. For now.</strong></p><p>(9:22) <em>If anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.</em></p><p>(9:24) <strong>FINE I WON’T KILL HIM.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(10:34) <em>Status?</em></p><p>(10:35) <u>Smiling smugly.</u></p><p>(10:36) <em>Good, good.</em></p><p>*</p><p>(10:36) <strong>Get a room, you two.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Tuesday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(11:45) <strong>I got ambushed.</strong></p><p>(11:46) <em>It’s about time Peter fought back.</em></p><p>(11:46) <strong>Not Pete…</strong></p><p>(11:46) <strong>Regulus cornered me.</strong></p><p>(11:47) <em>Oh. About what happened on Sunday?</em></p><p>(11:47) <strong>Yeah</strong></p><p>(11:48) <strong>He looked, idk, like he was worried?</strong></p><p>(11:48) <strong>About me? Which is weird.</strong></p><p>(11:48) <strong>Why does he give a shit.</strong></p><p>(11:50) <em>Because he cares about you, still?</em></p><p>(11:50) <strong>Yeah, yeah.</strong></p><p>(11:51) <strong>He said he won’t tell Satan’s Bitches, but he can’t guarantee the cousins won’t.</strong></p><p>(11:52) <em>Sirius, it sounds like he still wants to be apart of your life.</em></p><p>(11:53) <strong>I know, but we’ll see if I want him there or not.</strong></p><p>(11:53) <em>Ok. What else did he say?</em></p><p>(11:55) <strong>He says thanks, for looking after me.</strong></p><p>(11:58) <em>Um, he’s welcome?</em></p><p>(11:59) <strong>We’re meeting up on Saturday.</strong></p><p>(11:59) <strong>I agreed if he paid for lunch.</strong></p><p>(12:02) <em>Why are you so cheap?</em></p><p>(12:03) <strong>I think it’s a small price he’s paying</strong>.</p><p>(12:04) <em>Probably.</em></p><p>(12:04) <em>Are you ok going out with him? If you need support, or anything, I can come.</em></p><p>(12:06) <strong>AW MOONY.</strong></p><p>(12:06) <em>What?</em></p><p>(12:07) <strong>YOU’RE SUCH A SWEETHEART.</strong></p><p>(12:07) <em>You’re exaggerating! Shut up!</em></p><p>(12:08) <strong>You’re such a gentleman, my heart is swooning!</strong></p><p>(12:09) <em>I’m retracting my offer.</em></p><p>(12:11) <strong>It’ll be alright, Moony.

</p><p>(3:34) <em>I hate animals.</em></p><p>(3:36) <strong>You don’t mean that, surely.</strong></p><p>(3:37) <em>This goat has been trying to eat my pants for ten minutes.

That’s so cool!</strong></p><p>(3:47) <em>Sure, but right now I’m in charge of two ginger children and a goat.</em></p><p>(3:49)<strong> I can’t imagine which one is harder to handle.</strong></p><p>(3:51) <em>I can’t tell either. Both are trying my patience.</em></p><p>(3:53) <em>Ok! Charlie just tried to ride the cow! We’re going!</em></p><p>(3:54) <strong>Are you kidding?! Let the kid go! That’s so cool!</strong></p><p>(3:56) <em>He would take off with it. He’s an animal person. The cow was very willing to let him on.</em></p><p>(3:57) <em>We’re getting hotdogs now.</em></p><p>(3:58) <em>At 4:30 I promised Alice I’d help man her stall.</em></p><p>(3:59) <strong>What’s she doing?</strong></p><p>(4:00)<strong> It’s not a kissing booth, is it?</strong></p><p>(4:01) <em>Yes, it’s a kissing booth, that I have very voluntarily agreed to take part in.

  <strong>Dearest Nephew,</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I hope you are well. I, myself, in all of my bachelor glory, am doing splendidly. My llamas, also, are doing super swell. We’re just constantly on a rollercoaster of partying, llamas are such wild animals, but they’re also shivering. They miss their wool, but I just love knitting so much. Knitting fuels me with a fire that burns hotter than any man, woman, neither, both, or combination of the four, can ignite.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I used to be lonely, all on my bachelor own, but then I saw the light. Llamas are my true companions.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Shit, wait, don't get the wrong idea, Nephew Of Mine. I’m not… me and the llamas, we’re just friends, I swear. Nothing weird going on here. Not at all.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Despite this fire knitting brings me, technically, literally, it’s goddamn cold. I keep making all of these sweaters and then giving them away to nephews! Please send firewood. We’re so cold. There’s no heating up here in the</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>(we didn't previously decide where Alphard lived, so I’m just gonna make it up now)</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>In the Scottish Highlands.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>(seems like the kind of place Alphy the llama-<strike>fucker</strike>lover would hang out, right? secluded and all that)</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Anyway, hope you’re doing well. Like I totally am. And my llamas. My llama, Regulus, is doing wonderfully. I gave him a stupid haircut. He looks like a prick. Anyway, anyway, anyway.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Have a good day, Dearest Nephew. Please write soon. I need something to burn.</strong>
</p><p><strong>Love,</strong><br/> <strong>Your Uncle Alphard</strong><br/> <strong>The Hottest Scottish Bachelor</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(3:41) <em>I get the vague feeling that you didn’t like that Alphard wasn’t married.</em></p><p>(3:44) <strong>Am I not a hot stud, Moony? Why wouldn't I be married.</strong></p><p>(3:46) <em>Because you’re not actually Alphard.</em></p><p>(3:49) <strong>I feel like I embodied the character well!</strong></p><p>(3:50)<strong> Did the sweater arrive, too?</strong></p><p>(3:57) <em>It did. This is not a new sweater.</em></p><p>(4:01) <strong>No, I admit, it is not.</strong></p><p>(4:02) <em>It’s also not likely to be hand made.</em></p><p>(4:04) <strong>You overestimate my skill set.</strong></p><p>(4:06) <em>This most likely belonged to you.</em></p><p>(4:09) <strong>Most likely? Sheesh, I wouldn’t send you Prongs’ sweater. That’s just weird.</strong></p><p>(4:11)<em> Do you have a thing for me in your clothes?</em></p><p>(4:15) <strong>Hey!</strong></p><p>(4:15) <strong>If you don’t like the sweater, then send it back!</strong></p><p>(4:17) <em>You totally do!</em></p><p>(4:18) <strong>That’s it, give it back.</strong></p><p>(4:20) <em>No.</em></p><p>(4:21) <strong>Give me the sweater.</strong></p><p>(4:26) <em>No, you can’t have it back.</em></p><p>(4:26) <em>It was sent to me by my dear estranged uncle.</em></p><p>(4:30) <strong>Your uncle is creepy.</strong></p><p>(4:34) <em>He has questionable relationships with llamas, I admit. But his sweater is big and warm.</em></p><p>(4:36) <strong>So you’ll complain about the sweater, but you’ll still wear it?!</strong></p><p>(4:40) <em>Who ever said I was complaining? I was just asking a question.</em></p><p>(4:45) <strong>Ok, but I’m pleading the fifth.</strong></p><p>(4:46)<em> Saying nothing is just as well as saying yes.</em></p><p>(4:47) <strong>Interpret it however you please! The fact remains that I have not given an answer!</strong></p><p>(4:50) <em>You’re a mushy sentimentalist who likes me in your clothes!</em></p><p>(4:51) <strong>I am saying nothing!</strong></p><p>(4:54) <em>You’re cute.</em></p><p>(4:56) <strong>You’re giving me an early death.</strong></p><p>(4:58) <em>This is better. Usually I’m the one being tormented.</em></p><p>(5:04) <strong>I’m plotting payback as we speak.</strong></p><p>(5:05) <em>I suddenly have to go! Good-bye Padfoot!</em></p><p>(5:06) <strong>Coward!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(9:02) <em>Can I call you?</em></p><p>(9:03) <strong>Of course.</strong></p><p>
  <strong> <em>[Calling: Padfoot]</em> </strong>
</p><p>“<strong>Hey. Everything alright</strong>?”</p><p>“<em>Yes, yes. Just… wanted to talk to you.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok. Hang on, let me go somewhere devoid of eavesdropping friends.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I can hear their indignation in the background.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>They promise they won’t tease, but I don’t trust them.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Such little faith in your friends.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>It’s because I know them well enough. I won’t be tricked.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>It sounds like fun. I’ve probably said, but it’s like having a sleepover with your friends every day.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>It is, until you learn all of their gross habits.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Like spitting phlegm into a bucket?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Uh… Can't say they do that regularly. I was more thinking clipping their toenails in the dorm.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Alright, that is gross. So I guess, in comparison, phlegm is nothing?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Phlegm means nothing to me. I will fight all phlegm.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Ok, but can you wait for it to exit my body before you fight it? You might cause me damage otherwise.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Of course, Moony. Do you really think I’d be that cruel, to hurt an innocent bystander?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Well, your driving skills seem to suggest-</em>”</p><p>“<strong>When are you going to drop that?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Never, I think. My last words will probably be a critique of your driving abilities.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Not how much I’ve meant to you and how much you’ll miss me in the afterlife?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>No, no. Just how shit you are at driving.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>This is honestly so heartbreaking, Moony. It’s like you don’t even care.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Hmm… I’m wearing your sweater right now. Does that count as caring?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>What was the phrase you used? Mushy sentimentalist?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Yes, but I am willing to admit that.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Are you really? I’ll remember that.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’m having regrets.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>If you hadn’t had any regrets by now Moony, I would have been worried.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You expected my regrets from agreeing to this arrangement?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yea – hang on, did you just call our relationship an arrangement?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I did, but I see now that it was the wrong word. Arrangement suggests I’m getting something out of it.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>You’re getting clothes. A lot of clothes, actually.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Hm, that is true.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>It’s me that’s lacking.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I’d send you clothes, but there would be a high chance that I would just get them back.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Why won’t you let this go?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Two things I won’t let go, Padfoot. Your driving and your clothes sharing.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Not the fact that I literally killed your goldfish?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>I thought we were pinning that on Peter?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>I’m pretty much an accomplice after the fact. I mean, I tried to cover it up.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Well, at least it shows that in the event that I accidentally kill someone, you’ll be there to back me up.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>That’s… Actually probably true.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You’re either a natural liar or loyal.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Or, a murderer living vicariously.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>You don’t strike me as the murder type.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Really?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>No, not unless it was for revenge.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Are you writing up a criminal profile on me?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>If you ever wrong me, then I’ll have something to give to the police.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Blackmail.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Mhm.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Such a loving person you are.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Mm, you know me.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>You sound tired.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Don’t I always?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Ok, you sound more tired than usual.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Might be… because ‘m falling…</em>”</p><p>“<strong>F-falling? Like, what, exactly?</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Asleep.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Oh. Right. Yeah</strong>.”</p><p>“<em>You ok?</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Yeah, duh. Go to sleep, Moony.</strong>”</p><p>“<em>Already am, Padfoot.</em>”</p><p>“<strong>Good night.</strong>”</p><p>

  <u>Friday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:27) <strong>So, Wormtail got a passing mark for his history essay.</strong></p><p>(9:28) <em>I feel like there should be a ‘but’ here.</em></p><p>(9:29) <strong>BUT he does have to have a meeting with the teacher after class to discuss appropriate references.</strong></p><p>(9:30) <em>What on earth did you two reference?</em></p><p>(9:30) <em>Horrible Histories?</em></p><p>(9:31) <strong>You, of course!</strong></p><p>(9:31) <em>Me?</em></p><p>(9:31) <em>Oh, no, you didn’t honestly…</em></p><p>(9:33) <strong>“According to historians, Marie-Antoinette ‘didn’t deserve this,’ as she was executed in 1793 for treason.”</strong></p><p>(9:34) <em>I don’t want to know what the bibliography said.</em></p><p>(9:35) <strong>Are you sure? It was properly formatted.</strong></p><p>(9:35) <strong>Lupin, RJ 2014, ‘Texts to Padfoot’, Vodaphone Network UK.</strong></p><p>(9:38) <em>Oh, God. And Wormtail still passed?</em></p><p>(9:38) <strong>Hey, the rest of the essay was good!</strong></p><p>(9:40)<em> Well, forgive me for being skeptical!</em></p><p>(9:41) <strong>You have no faith, Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:42) <strong>Oh! Speaking of faith!</strong></p><p>(9:42) <em>I don’t like where this is going.</em></p><p>(9:42)<strong> Are you busy this evening?</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>… Define busy.</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>Are you leaving your house for some super important engagement?</strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>No, not currently, but I get the feeling I’m going to suddenly make up an excuse saying I am.</em></p><p>(9:48) <strong>Why don’t you want to see your boyfriend, Moony?</strong></p><p>(9:50)<em> It’s not that I don’t want to see him, it’s just that I’m always wary of his plans.</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>It’s nothing insane, you can trust him.</strong></p><p>(9:54) <em>Can I? There’s no law-breaking, is there?</em></p><p>(9:55) <strong>No law-breaking. Uh, maybe some blasphemy, though.</strong></p><p>(9:57) <em>… What the hell, Padfoot?</em></p><p>(9:58) <strong>Well, by traditional standards it might not be the done thing. But we owe it to them.</strong></p><p>(9:59) <em>I am very confused now. You’re not propositioning me?</em></p><p>(10:02) <strong>Proposi</strong></p><p>(10:02) <strong>HAHA MOONY. NO.</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>It is the only time anyone ever uses the word ‘blasphemy,’ ok?</em></p><p>(10:04) <strong>Sure, sure. Get your head out of the gutter.</strong></p><p>(10:05) <em>That’s what I usually say to you.</em></p><p>(10:06)<strong> And look how the tables have turned. So, anyway, you available tonight?</strong></p><p>(10:07) <em>Sure, I guess. Tell me then, what are we doing?</em></p><p>(10:08) <strong>We’re going to hold a memorial service.</strong></p><p>(10:08) <em>For my sanity?</em></p><p>(10:10) <strong>For Sheba!</strong></p><p>(10:11) <em>I just checked the fish bowl, wondering what you had done now, until I realised you meant the first one.</em></p><p>(10:11) <strong>Yes, I meant the first one! We haven’t done anything to commemorate them.</strong></p><p>(10:13) <em>That’s because… they’re a fish. Were a fish.</em></p><p>(10:14) <strong>They may be in a kitty’s belly, Moony, but they will always be a fish.</strong></p><p>(10:15) <em>And they will forever swim in your heart, I know.</em></p><p>(10:16) <strong>Hey, that was actually pretty good. I’m adding it.</strong></p><p>(10:17) <em>Adding it to what?</em></p><p>(10:17) <strong>The eulogy I’m going to give.</strong></p><p>(10:19) <em>This can’t be ser</em></p><p>(10:19) <em>This isn’t real.</em></p><p>(10:21) <strong>Guess you could say it was ser-real.</strong></p><p>(10:22) <strong>Get it? Ser-real, surreal?!!</strong></p><p>(10:23) <em>Stop this immediately.</em></p><p>(10:26) <strong>You started it. Wait until you hear the eulogy, Moons.</strong></p><p>(10:27) <em>This is how I’m going to spend my Friday night?</em></p><p>(10:27) <em>Don’t you have training?</em></p><p>(10:28) <strong>Oh, come on. What do you usually do on a Friday night?</strong></p><p>(10:29) <strong>And James is letting us rest today.</strong></p><p>(10:30) <em>I’d usually be watching a very nice movie that isn’t about dead fish.</em></p><p>(10:31) <strong>Don’t like Finding Nemo then, huh?</strong></p><p>(10:32) <em>Let’s not go there. It’s a cry-fest.</em></p><p>(10:35) <strong>So meet me at the Hogsmeade Botanical gardens, 4pm?</strong></p><p>(10:36) <em>Fine, ok.</em></p><p>(10:37) <strong>Yes! Brilliant!</strong></p><p>(10:39) <em>This isn’t going to be counted as a date, is it?</em></p><p>(10:39) <strong>Why not?</strong></p><p>(10:40) <em>It’s a bit depressing. Second date at a funeral.</em></p><p>(10:41) <strong>Not even a funeral. We have no body. A memorial.</strong></p><p>(10:42) <strong>Grief can bring us closer.</strong></p><p>(10:43) <em>You’re hitting on me through the death of a goldfish?

  <u>Friday PM</u>
</p><p>(3:58) <strong>I’m waiting!</strong></p><p>(3:58) <em>You’re early.</em></p><p>(3:58) <strong>By two minutes. You here yet?</strong></p><p>(3:59)<em> Just about. Main gate?</em></p><p>(3:59) <strong>Yeah – haha, I see you</strong></p><p>*</p><p>“Nice outfit,” Sirius said as soon as Remus was within earshot.</p><p>It looked like Remus had trouble finding anything suitably black, his jeans looking well worn and rolled up at the cuff, which Sirius suspected was because they were too short for him. His jacket, on the other hand, looked far too big for him for it to even be fashionable, hanging off his frame like a heavy burden. </p><p>“Shut up,” Remus replied with no real bite. “Had to borrow one of my dad’s jackets. And these jeans are way too short.”</p><p>Sirius, in his all-black outfit that he picked from whatever was lying on the floor, frowned at him. “You mean you don’t own black clothes?”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes, but his cheeks were twitching into a smile and Sirius didn’t stop himself from holding out his hand. Remus took it easily.</p><p>“You know me, I live in neon colours.”</p><p>Sirius nodded. “You are quite the neon rager.”</p><p>Their walk through the gardens was quiet. Every now and then Sirius would feel a light touch on his head, Remus’ hand retracting to flick away a fallen leaf.</p><p>“Did you prepare a speech?” Sirius asked him as they passed under a willow, it’s reaching branches caressing their faces.</p><p>Remus screwed up his face. “No,” he said. “I was thinking I should wing it. Makes it more from the heart, that way.”</p><p>Sirius snorted. “I don’t believe you’re taking this as sincerely as you should.”</p><p>Remus gasped, holding a hand over his chest. “Are you implying that I’m not taking this fish funeral, dare I say, seriously?”</p><p>“You dare not say it!” Sirius commanded, albeit with a grin on his face. “Your happy demeanor and flippant attitude suggests that you do not care one iota for our fallen soldier.”</p><p>Sirius tugged on his hand, pulling Remus off the man-made path and onto the grass. The ground was still slightly wet from earlier rain, dew clinging to the blades fruitlessly as Sirius’ feet sent the drops falling into the air again.</p><p>“Fallen soldier?” Remus asked. “What war did they fight in?”</p><p>Sirius thought. “Did you really think you won the sheep wars without a little back up?”</p><p>“And just where are Sheba’s dog tags?”</p><p>“Lost in the battlefield,” Sirius said quickly. “It was tragic, we all cried.”</p><p>Remus raised an eyebrow, a smile fighting on his face as he struggled to keep up with Sirius’ pace. “Now who’s being flippant?”</p><p>The ground started to dip downhill. Sirius slowed his steps, keeping a firm grip on Remus’ hand so he doesn’t go stumbling all the way to the bottom. Their feet slip slightly on the wet grass, but they make it to the edge of the lake safe.</p><p>“I’m allowed to be flippant right now,” Sirius told him. “For I have a heartfelt speech ready.”</p><p>“Really,” Remus said blandly. “I suppose we’re doing it here, then?”</p><p>The lake wasn't anything special to look at, a murky grey of polluted water edged with dying reeds. The ducks waddling by the bank don’t even flinch at their arrival, continuing on their path as if they weren’t there. They look old, and as grey as the lake itself, but Sirius figured it was the next best place to hold the memorial.</p><p>“Look,” Sirius said, disentangling his hand from Remus’ to shuffle through his jean pockets. He pulled out a small paper-made boat, puffing it out for it to take on a three dimensional shape, holding it up on his palm proudly. On the inside of the boat is a little drawn fish, it’s eyes replaced with x’s.</p><p>Remus took the boat gingerly, trying to suppress a smile as he sternly said, “This is morbid.”</p><p>Sirius faked offense. “It’s art!”</p><p>He took back the boat, resting it on the bank so only the lips of the lake could kiss the bow, and then took out another piece of paper from his pocket.</p><p>The writing on the paper was a messy scrawl, hurriedly written in between periods and work assignments, with parts crossed out angrily and some unhelpful commentary from James.</p><p>He cleared his throat theatrically, shaking out the paper in front of him and glancing over at Remus. He was still trying to keep in his laughter, and Sirius appreciated his level of commitment to playing along.</p><p>“Dearly beloved,” Sirius bellowed. “We are gathered here to-<em>ray</em> to mourn the passing of Sheba the goldfish.”</p><p>Remus moved up to stand right beside him, their shoulders pressing into each other. Sirius could feel Remus’ shoulder shake as he tried to hold in his giggles.</p><p>“We’ll greatly miss Sheba,” Sirius continued, “And all of the <em>koi</em> that they brought us. Especially to dear Remus, who would have been <em>drowning</em> in the f<em>eel</em>-ing of loneliness without their company. It’s a real tragedy what happened to them, with no one <em>sole</em> to blame except the ever-present rivalry between <em>Carassius auratus</em> and <em>Felis catus</em>.” Sirius paused at his effortless pronunciation, turning to Remus for praise.</p><p>“You practiced the speech,” he said in disbelief.</p><p>“Duh,” Sirius drawled, and then started reading again. “Except maybe Peter. Peter is also to blame. And maybe Filch, the janitor, for keeping a cat in the first place. What if there are students who are allergic? Anyway, Sheba will be greatly missed. They are irreplaceable –”</p><p>“You literally replaced them,” Remus cut in.</p><p>“They are irreplaceable,” Sirius repeated sternly, “And will forever continue to swim in the ocean of our hearts, eternally unburdened by the constraints of a tiny fish bowl.”</p><p>“Goldfish are fresh water,” Remus mumbled. “Can’t swim in the sea.”</p><p>Sirius sighed exasperatedly, turning a doleful eye on Remus. “Like your speech is better.”</p><p>“What speech?” Remus asked innocently.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Sirius folded up the paper, slipping it back into his pocket and pulling out a lighter. He crouched in front of the tiny paper boat, ready to flick the spark wheel before craning his neck to look over at Remus.</p><p>“Any last words?”</p><p>“Rest in peace, Sheba,” Remus said solemnly, folding his hands in front of him and hanging his head.</p><p>“Rest in fucking pieces,” Sirius whispered as he lit the boat on fire, making sure the flames were spreading out before pushing it into the lake. The boat swirled in the light current made by the wind, not going far from the bank. He prodded it with a stick, sending it further in until the paper gave out from the pressure of the fire above it and the water soaking below it.</p><p>Not long after, the boat was gone.</p><p>Sirius rose, turning to Remus with a jovial smile that instantly fell as soon as he saw him. Remus had his hands on his face, his whole body shaking with strange, muffled cries coming from his mouth.</p><p>“Moony?” Sirius said. “Hey, are you actually crying? I’m sorry about Sheba, Remus –”</p><p>Remus’ hands fell from his face, the first thing Sirius taking note of was the streaks of tears down his cheeks, but then he hunched over, hands on his knees, as he laughed, until it turned into coughing.</p><p>Sirius smacked him lightly on the shoulder. “You scared me! I thought I really traumatised you!”</p><p>“N-no,” Remus said, swiping tears away from his face. “This is so absurd. You’re weird!”</p><p>Sirius was about to take offense before Remus leaned against him, linking their hands with his head on Sirius’ shoulder. He was still giggling, slightly breathless and clearing his throat constantly, and Sirius couldn’t help but rub his cheek against his hair.</p><p>“I haven’t laughed like this in years,” Remus said quietly. Sirius stilled, his grip on Remus’ hand tightening slightly, and kissed Remus on the head.</p><p>“I haven’t wanted to make someone laugh like this,” Sirius said as he realised it. “Ever.”</p><p>Remus turned his head, looking at Sirius with tear-shiny eyes, reminding him of the gently rippling lake water that swallowed Sheba’s memorial. Sirius wouldn’t mind being swallowed up in Remus’ eyes, full of mirth and kindness.</p><p>Sirius tugged at their linked hands, begging Remus to follow him through the gardens for their next destination. Sirius knew it would be getting dark soon, the chill breeze washing through them a strong indication, not that he minded. Remus pulled in closer to him after each wave of cold air, until Sirius removed his hands from Remus’ so he could throw his arm over his shoulder, rubbing Remus’ arm.</p><p>“Will you be alright in the cold?” Sirius asked as they walked.</p><p>“Oh, I’m fine,” Remus replied easily, and Sirius believed him.</p><p>“So you’re just using it as an excuse to get close,” Sirius confirmed. He laughed when Remus ducked his head shyly, poking him in the cheek and cooing. “Can’t say I’m not impressed, though.”</p><p>They stopped when they reached the foot of the hill. Sirius turned to Remus, a sly smirk on his face.</p><p>“Would you like me to carry you again?”</p><p>Remus shook his head profusely. “I can do it this time,” and then poked his tongue out at Sirius.</p><p>They walked slowly up the hill, not in any rush to reach the top, and although Sirius would usually declare a race he figured Remus wouldn’t appreciate the challenge.</p><p>He almost changed his mind when Remus asked him if he even knew any other date destinations.</p><p>“I’d like to see you pick a location!” Sirius exclaimed. “I’m the one carrying this relationship.”</p><p>“I went to one of your football games. I’ll come to this one too, then.”</p><p>Sirius waved him off. “Nah, it’s an away game. Not worth it.”</p><p>If Sirius didn’t know any better, he would have thought that Remus looked genuinely disappointed.</p><p>They finally reached the top, even after Remus declared that ‘here was close enough’ not even half way up, and Sirius spread his jacket on the grass for them to sit on.</p><p>The sun would be setting over Hogsmeade soon, giving them a different view from Saturday, and when Remus realised what they were doing he gave a derisive snort.</p><p>“This is so cliché,” he told Sirius.</p><p>“It’s romantic,” Sirius countered. “Just shut up and swoon.”</p><p>“I’m swooning, I'm swooning,” Remus mumbled, letting his head fall onto Sirius’ shoulder again. Sirius still didn’t mind.</p><p>They didn’t speak as they watched the sun set, the rooftops of Hogsmeade painted in a gentle hue of orange. The town seemed to glow, and even Remus’ face was alight in marigold that Sirius couldn’t help leaning over and kissing his cheek.</p><p>Remus giggled, but instead of shying away like Sirius expected, he turned fully to face him. He was fighting a smile back as he came closer, stopping just short of connecting their lips.</p><p>“So cliché,” he mumbled. Sirius could feel his breath warm against his skin.</p><p>Sirius closed the space, pecking Remus briefly before pulling back to say, “Just let me seduce you with the sunset.”</p><p>Remus kissed him briefly in turn. “Did I say I was complaining?”</p><p>“I don’t know, are you?” Sirius settled his hand on Remus’ neck, his thumb rubbing circles at the hinge of his jaw. “Sounded like you were.”</p><p>Remus sighed heavily, “You talk too much,” then closed the gap between them one final time.</p><p>Their lips became the central point of heat, blazing out to warm their cheeks and flush their necks, a trail creeping down their spines. Sirius could no longer feel the cold breeze, ignited from the outside in with a warmth in his chest he was sure wasn’t purely physical.</p><p>His heart beat faster as Remus opened his mouth, shyly flicking his tongue along Sirius’ bottom lip. Remus’ hand had finally come up to tangle in Sirius’ hair, although when that happened, Sirius didn’t know.</p><p>Remus drew back slightly, mumbling something Sirius didn't catch, and then he was trailing kisses from his chin along his jawline, lips pressed at Sirius’ temple and then hovering above his right eye, lips lingering longest there.</p><p>“For your migraine named Regulus,” Remus whispered.</p><p>Then he continued, along Sirius’ forehead, down his nose and back up again, working on the left side of his face with light kisses. It tickled all over his face, Sirius unable to stop the giggles, unable to stop the welling feeling in his chest as Remus dragged his hand from Sirius’ hair to caress his face.</p><p>Sirius was unable to stop the pinpricks of tears that stung his eyes, and he refused to look Remus in the face as he burrowed his head into the crook of Remus’ neck.</p><p>“Are you ok?” Remus asked.</p><p>Sirius just nodded, placed a small kiss on Remus’ neck.</p><p>Remus returned his hand to his hair, twirling strands around his fingers and rubbing Sirius’ scalp soothingly. In the darkness of his hideaway, Sirius thought about the last time he felt this safe, felt this adored, but it had been years ago, when Mrs Potter had first embraced him and welcomed him to her home, and not even then had it felt like this. The warmth of Remus’ entire body soaking into his, the feel of his soft hands on Sirius’ skin and the way his lips felt all over Sirius’ face felt infinitely different.</p><p>He didn’t know in what way, didn’t think it mattered in what way just yet, but Sirius knew in that moment as he quietly wept against Remus that he loved this boy, would love Remus until the end of his days. And he knew, in the way Remus wiped away the tears from Sirius’ cheeks without a word, that Remus loved him too, and it didn’t matter to Sirius in what way, just that any way would be enough for him.</p><p>He would have said it then, if it didn’t also completely terrify him, but then Remus was whispering into his ear, comforting words, words sounding like how Sirius felt, soothing and sweet and one hundred percent honest.</p><p>Sirius didn’t need to say it. Remus probably knew.</p><p>The sun dipped well below the horizon, completely forgotten by the two boys.</p><p>*</p><p>Sirius wasn’t used to emotional vulnerability.</p><p>Now that they had gotten up, and started walking back to Remus’ house, Sirius began to panic, looking over at Remus every two seconds to see if he was disgusted yet.</p><p>He could see the dark stain on Remus’ shirt, but the other boy didn’t seem to notice, or care.</p><p>When it had started to get too cold, Remus pulled back, standing and offering a hand to Sirius so they could walk home. Sirius had gratefully accepted his hand, and they hadn’t let go since.</p><p>That’s got to mean something, right? They had hardly spoken, only a short argument where Sirius insisted he walk Remus home, and Remus didn’t look like he was eager to get back home, to get away from Sirius. If anything, he looked a little dazed, a small smile permanently stuck on his face every time Sirius took a glance at him.</p><p>When they paused at Remus’ neighbours, Remus looking more than reluctant to leave, Sirius assured himself that his emotional outburst hadn’t fucked it up, and that Remus didn’t care.</p><p>“My stop,” he said regretfully.</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius said, just as reluctant to let Remus go.</p><p>“Thanks for the… memorial.” Remus said, but it sounded like a question. He smiled shyly, scuffing his shoes on the footpath. “Ok, no, thank you for the sunset.”</p><p>“Thank you for the kissing,” Sirius teased, and Remus sighed, trying to pull away from him.</p><p>Sirius tugged him back and kissed him firmly, about to pull away when Remus’ hands came up to hold his face in place, kissing back with a fervor that Sirius really didn’t mind.</p><p>When Remus drew back his breath was coming out short, throwing a few small coughs into the crook of his elbow while Sirius kissed the top of his head. Then he started shuffling away, walking backwards as long as he could so he could keep looking at Sirius, finally turning around to walk up the path. Sirius watched him until his front door was firmly shut.</p><p>Sirius skipped back all the way to school.</p><p>*</p><p>

</p><p>(10:34) <em>It’s your Regulus thing today, isn’t it?</em></p><p>(10:35) <strong>Yup, and he insists on meeting on the grounds and walking there together. Talk about awkward.</strong></p><p>(10:37) <em>You’re gonna let him leave alive, right?</em></p><p>(10:38) <strong>I thought you said I wasn’t the murdering type.</strong></p><p>(10:40) <em>Unless it was for revenge, I said.</em></p><p>(10:44) <strong>I wouldn’t exact revenge for myself, though.</strong></p><p>(10:49) <em>No?</em></p><p>(10:50) <strong>Nah. I’d get you or James or Peter to do it.</strong></p><p>(10:51) <em>Oh, marvellous.</em></p><p>(10:51) <em>I think I’ll leave it to James.</em></p><p>(10:55) <strong>Yeah, you should. He’d be the most competent.</strong></p><p>(10:58) <em>I’m trying not to be offended.</em></p><p>(11:01) <strong>You have too much of a conscience.</strong></p><p>(11:04) <em>I laughed at a memorial.</em></p><p>(11:05) <strong>Ok, you have a WEIRD conscience, but you’ve got one.</strong></p><p>(11:06) <em>And James doesn’t? He struck me as the mercy type.</em></p><p>(11:07) <strong>Oh, boy. No way. That guy is all justice.</strong></p><p>(11:08) <em>Justice James.</em></p><p>(11:10) <strong>Exactly. He’s told me he’ll kick Regulus’ arse if he does anything funny today.</strong></p><p>(11:14) <em>Oh good, so I don’t have to try and make that promise now.</em></p><p>(11:15) <strong>Nah, it’s been covered for you. You got lucky.</strong></p><p>(11:16) <em>I’ll send James flowers and a thank you card.</em></p><p>(11:17) <strong>How are my flowers?</strong></p><p>(11:20) <em>Good. New Sheba likes to look at them. I think.</em></p><p>(11:25) <strong>Alright, I’m meeting Reg now.</strong></p><p>(11:25) <em>Good luck. I’m right here.</em></p><p>(11:26) <strong>Thanks, Remus.

</p><p>(2:08) <strong>I have been released.</strong></p><p>(2:09) <em>Any scars?</em></p><p>(2:10) <strong>Surprisingly not.</strong></p><p>(2:10) <strong>He apologized for what he said weeks ago and just wanted to know if I was actually happier being away from mum and dad or if I was being a little shit.</strong></p><p>(2:11) <em>You’re always a little shit, though.</em></p><p>(2:15) <strong>Thanks, Moony. I know.</strong></p><p>(2:16) <strong>ANYWAY he said he can’t promise that they don’t know about the bike thing but they haven’t said anything to him yet.</strong></p><p>(2:17) <em>Is that a good sign or a bad sign?</em></p><p>(2:19) <strong>A good sign. Usually when I mess up they love to turn it into a learning experience for Reg. ‘Don't end up like Sirius, the miserable son who got arrested.’</strong></p><p>(2:20) <em>Maybe they’re waiting to use it for when Regulus messes up.</em></p><p>(2:21) <strong>Regulus doesn’t mess up! He’s a careful kid.</strong></p><p>(2:22) <strong>So, it wasn’t that bad. He asked if we could do it again and I said ok. I know he’s just doing what he needs to so it’s easier.</strong></p><p>(2:25) <em>As long as it makes you happy.</em></p><p>(2:26) <strong>I’m all about the happiness, Moony.</strong></p><p>(2:26) <strong>Not that it was all shit before but… Things just seem better now.

Talk to you later?</strong></p><p>(2:30) <em>I have a check up this afternoon and then going to Alice’s. Maybe not so much.</em></p><p>(2:32) <strong>That’s ok. Cya, Moony!</strong></p><p>(2:32) <em>Have fun.</em></p><p>(2:33) <strong>Pft, yeah, you too.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(7:42) <strong>I keep forgetting to mention!</strong></p><p>(7:42)<strong> James’ birthday on Thursday, party at the Potters’.

That’s the present.</strong></p><p>(7:54) <em>For you, maybe.</em></p><p>(7:55) <strong>And isn’t that all that matters? Me?</strong></p><p>(7:56) <em>I’ll get him a watch.</em></p><p>(7:59) <strong>A watch?</strong></p><p>(7:59) <em>It’s an adult thing to have.</em></p><p>(8:01) <strong>That’s fair enough reasoning.

  <u>Monday AM</u>
</p><p>As soon as he stepped foot on the grounds he knew this was a bad idea.</p><p>There were hundreds of students milling about the building, none of them paying any mind to Remus as he shifted through them, trying to find some sign or direction to where the boy’s dormitories were kept. So far all he had found was the teacher’s car park and the kissing tree, complete with a couple lip locked and oblivious to Remus’ embarrassment.</p><p>He hoped to find a familiar face, but with all the students in their uniform, they all pretty much looked the same. Remus became so overwhelmed with claustrophobia and a sense of drowning that he would have fallen had not a hand been clapped onto his shoulder at that time.</p><p>“Remus?” a friendly voice asked, and turning, saw a girl with brilliant green eyes and familiar dark red hair.</p><p>“Lily,” Remus sighed with relief, and she smiled and began steering him out of the flood of students.</p><p>“Looking for Sirius, I assume?”</p><p>Remus just nodded, allowing himself to be directed into the building and down a long corridor.</p><p>“I don't know if he’s with James, but if not, James will know where he is.”</p><p>Remus nodded again, resigning himself to the fact that it was too late to turn back now.</p><p>She led him through the grounds, around buildings and between bike rakes that Remus quickly became lost in the campus. He wouldn't have been able to get back home by himself if he suddenly chickened out now.</p><p>Lily seemed to notice his unease, patting him easily on the shoulder and gripping his sleeve to direct him through the stream of people.</p><p>They finally enter one of the buildings, walking down the wide corridors, past numerous numbered doors that looked as if they were built in the medieval times. It was more a castle than a regular school, the wood of the classroom doors thick and hinged by iron, with a high ceiling coming to a peak.</p><p>“This place is huge,” Remus told Lily.</p><p>Lily nodded empathetically. “I’m here on a scholarship. You have no idea how scary this place was in my first year. Lots of good hiding places, though.”</p><p>She winked at him.</p><p>They turned one final corner, finally meeting a group of students hovering in small groups near a classroom. James spotted them immediately, probably looking out for Lily’s arrival, and gave Remus a big whack on the back when they reach him.</p><p>Remus coughed, “There goes a lung.”</p><p>James grinned. “Oh well, it’s not like it was doing good by you anyway.”</p><p>Remus spotted Peter running up behind James, planting his hands on James’ shoulders and jumping behind him. “Hey, Moony!”</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>“You here to see Sirius?”</p><p>Remus nodded, looking around in the crowd of students to find him before James drew him back.</p><p>“He’s still in the dorm,” he said.</p><p>“Probably doing his hair,” Peter added.</p><p>James slung an arm around Remus’ shoulders, and told Lily that he and Peter were probably going to be a little late.</p><p>“It’s your funeral,” she said and pecked him on the cheek before walking to class.</p><p>Again, Remus allowed himself to be dragged through the corridor that was now piling up with students and teachers. James chattered in his ears about this and that, but Remus wasn’t really listening, couldn’t really listen with all of his own thoughts swimming around in his head.</p><p>“Hey,” Peter’s voice cut through. “You ok, mate?”</p><p>Remus shrugged. “Things are tense at home at the moment. Didn’t really want to be there.”</p><p>Peter nodded, also throwing his arm over Remus’ shoulders and walking on his tippy toes to keep up with his height.</p><p>“Sirius mentioned,” James said. “Mum’s crying about empty nesting it soon, so if you needed somewhere to stay I think she just might erupt with gratitude.”</p><p>“I don’t think that will be necessary,” Remus said quickly. “But, um, thank you.”</p><p>James shrugged. “Here to help! Right, Pete?”</p><p>“Right,” Peter huffed. Remus could see a bead of sweat falling down the side of Peter’s face from trying to climb stairs as well as keep his arm around Remus. He thought about putting the boy out of his misery and detaching himself, but Remus quite liked the reassurance, and the dedication Peter was showing in the action.</p><p>When they rounded the corner the corridor was deserted, and Remus began to worry that they had missed him, that he was sitting in class wondering where his friends were.</p><p>A door to his left opened suddenly, and a mess of a boy with half his shirt on came sprinting out. He was pulling his shirt over his head while trying to do up a tie but also wedge on a shoe. His head popped out of the collar before he could collide with them, with Remus, and he suddenly stopped in his tracks and stared.</p><p>Sirius’ hair was sticking up at strange angles, some of the buttons of his shirt still weren’t done up and none of his laces were tied, but he stopped in the middle of the corridor to stare at Remus, his mouth falling open and closing like a fish.</p><p>“Remus!” he shouted in surprise, but his face read an expression of pure joy. “You’re a maniac. What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Oh, I was actually on my way to Tesco for some milk and got lost. Really, why do you think I’m here?”</p><p>“It’s a great historical building. I know you’re a nerd like that.”</p><p>“I’m not interested in the building.”</p><p>“Uh, hi,” Peter cut in, “Hate to interrupt this fantastic flirting, but James and I have a class to attend. So do you, Sirius, but I guess that’s off the table.”</p><p>“Anyway, lads,” James clapped Remus’ shoulders again, “We’ll leave you two to it.”</p><p>“Have fun!” Peter cheered as he turned away from them.</p><p>“Be safe!” James added, following Peter.</p><p>“Don’t touch my stuff!” Peter called from down the corridor.</p><p>“Don’t die!” James shouted as he turned the corner.</p><p>There was a pause, and then a distant echo of Peter’s voice, “Don’t let the boogeyman get you!”</p><p>Then there was silence.</p><p>“Let’s go inside,” Sirius said. “I mean. If you’re staying.”</p><p>“Of course I’m staying.”</p><p>Sirius nodded, turning back to the room he came from and waited for Remus to follow. Remus entered the dorm first, his eyes adjusting to the sudden darkness of the room, and he could smell a distinct scent of sweat and mud.</p><p>His foot caught on something on the floor and he staggered into a bedpost. He swore under his breath, cursing whatever mysterious object sought to trip him.</p><p>“You alright?” Sirius’ voice came from the darkness.</p><p>“What the hell is all over the floor?”</p><p>“This and that. Bits and pieces. I guess it’s not really, uh, visitor friendly.” Sirius at least had the decency to sound embarrassed.</p><p>“It’s like a minefield,” Remus muttered. “Is your electricity bust or something?”</p><p>Sirius said deliberately, “I don’t recommend turning on the lights.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Remus could hear Sirius shuffling around somewhere to the right of the room, throwing items around as he sifted closer to his destination. “Attracts the moths.”</p><p>“It’s nine in the morning.”</p><p>“Do you really think a place like this cares for the time of day? This dorm room does as it pleases. Including becoming infested with moths that appear in the day time.”</p><p>Remus blindly started reaching around the room, trying to find some furniture to guide him, wanting to edge his way to the windows.</p><p>“James and Peter’s warnings make sense now,” Remus said. “I’m very concerned about the hygiene of this place.”</p><p>Sirius stopped shuffling around in the darkness. “Is it… are you going to be ok?”</p><p>“What? Oh. Yes, fine. When I say that I mean purely in a germophobe way. I can’t see anything but I’m sure there’s mold.”</p><p>“It’s a science project,” Sirius said quickly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The mold. Don’t touch it. It’s for science.”</p><p>“I really hope you’re joking. Aha!”</p><p>Remus found the edge of the curtains, and dramatically threw them back to reveal the sunlight of the morning, allowing it to come streaming into the room and cast light on all the rubbish and clothes strewn all over the floor.</p><p>“I didn’t know we had curtains!” Sirius whined. “I thought they just blacked out the windows!”</p><p>“You’re unbelievable,” Remus admonished. He felt better now that he could see Sirius, unevenly buttoned shirt and all. The stress of the last few hours were wearing on Remus, and he suddenly felt exhausted, wanting nothing but to curl up in Sirius’ arms and stay there.</p><p>Sirius shuffled over to him, his face soft and concerned, his feet sure on the uneven ground. His ease made Remus fully realise, this was Sirius’ space, his home in the months between holidays. It made him feel warm.</p><p>“Everything ok? Well,” Sirius amended, “I know it’s not, really. And this is a surprise. You didn’t strike me as the running away type.”</p><p>A corner of Remus’ mouth twitched against his will. “M’not running away. Dad’s been weird and I didn’t want to be around it anymore. I’ve not done anything wrong.”</p><p>“No, you haven’t,” Sirius agreed, but then smirked. “Still. You call me dramatic.”</p><p>“I’m not running away!” Remus laughed, shoving Sirius lightly. “That’s what James thought, too.”</p><p>“He’s got experience with runaways.” Sirius shrugged. “Mrs Potter would be happy to have you.”</p><p>Remus raised an eyebrow. “Have you and James discussed this?”</p><p>Sirius laughed. “No, actually. It’s just that Mrs Potter is always a good option for a quick fix. She’s a miracle.”</p><p>“She does give off magical vibes,” Remus agreed. “Things will be fine. My mum says that Dad just needs to get used to the idea. I’m just really pissed that he took my phone.”</p><p>Remus paused, chewing on his bottom lip, wondering if he should keep talking. Sirius waited, eventually poking his cheek to get Remus talking again.</p><p>“I don’t like being isolated,” Remus started. “Obviously I don’t get out and meet people often and they usually can’t come see me so it’s the only way I can talk to people… I don’t know,” he trailed off. “It’s stupid.”</p><p>“Not at all,” Sirius said sincerely. “It’s how we meet, isn’t it?”</p><p>Remus looked up at Sirius’ face, suddenly struck by his brilliant smile and eyes alight with happiness. Remus nearly stepped back from the intensity, suddenly quite embarrassed by Sirius’ words, and the conviction he said them with, as if their meeting was the most important thing in the world to him.</p><p>Remus was stuck with what to do, and before he realised what he was doing, he reached out and began unbuttoning and buttoning back up Sirius’ shirt. When he finished, he undid Sirius’ tie, and lined it up to redo, only this time properly and neatly. His face felt hot from what he was doing, and could feel Sirius’ confused expression burn into his skin, but he kept going.</p><p>“What… are you doing?” Sirius asked slowly.</p><p>“I didn’t know what else to do,” Remus replied truthfully.</p><p>“And so you decided to dress me?” Sirius laughed. “Your train of thought is weird.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. “Not all of our brains are hardwired for the opposite.”</p><p>Sirius started shaking, and Remus had to look up from his task to see that Sirius was giggling, holding his hand over his mouth.</p><p>“What’s so funny?” Remus demanded, pulling the tie just a little too tight.</p><p>“You said ‘hard’wired.”</p><p>Remus laughed despite himself, punching Sirius in the arm while the boy continued to laugh into his hands. Remus couldn't help but laugh too as Sirius slowly lost control, and tears started coming out his eyes as he laughed harder.</p><p>“You’ve gone wrong,” Remus said, but soon he was just as far gone as Sirius, the stress and anxiety of the past day seeping out of him in waves of laughter, and soon his head was resting on Sirius’ shoulder as he continued to laugh.</p><p>Sirius pressed his nose into Remus’ hair as he slid his arms around Remus’ waist, and they stayed like that well after Remus’ giggling fit subsided. Remus felt hands rest on his shoulders, sliding his own up Sirius back to pause at his shoulder blades, thinking about the phoenix that flew beneath his left hand.</p><p>Sirius pulled back a little to press their foreheads together. Remus could feel his breath on his face, and he smiled shyly as he trailed his hand down Sirius’ arm until his fingers found his hand. He linked their fingers together, Sirius compliant, and looked to watch their hands slide together, fascinated by the way they fitted perfectly together.</p><p>Remus felt the slide of Sirius’ skin on his own, the hands molding together, their noses bumping into each other, and then hesitantly, the feel of Sirius’ lips hovering close to his own, waiting, asking a question Remus would always say yes to.</p><p>Their lips connected, gentle but yearning. It felt different to Remus this time, perhaps because it was behind closed doors in Sirius’ room, or it was the assurance of Sirius’ presence in his life, no matter how much his father wanted it to be different. Sirius would always be here.</p><p>Sirius would be right by Remus’ side, no matter what.</p><p>Remus pressed against him, Sirius’ hands sliding down Remus’ sides where they stopped at his hips, and he began swirling small circles with the pad of his thumb on his hipbones. Remus tugged on his tie to bring them closer, a death grip on his school shirt, slotting his legs in the spaces between Sirius’, feeling the pressure of something against his knees.</p><p>His heart was in his throat when he felt Sirius ungracefully fall back, landing safely on a bed, but also bringing Remus down on top of him.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Sirius,” Remus growled, but it sounded less like a threat. “Scoot up, my legs are still dangling over the edge.”</p><p>Sirius backed up, resting his head on the pillow, and watched as Remus followed, straddling on top of him with his legs wedged between his own. There was a tightness in Remus’ stomach as he climbed on top of Sirius, gently pressing their bodies together, scared his weight would crush Sirius. Remus reached up to touch Sirius’ face, hands shaking slightly, relief and affection washing over his as Sirius put his hands over Remus’ and feeling them shake just as much. Sirius smiled up at him, and Remus could feel that smile as they kissed, and without much prompt began opening his mouth wider to allow Sirius in.</p><p>Remus didn’t know how long it had been, but it was too soon when he had to pull away, trying hard to regulate his breath. He nuzzled into Sirius’ neck like a puppy, his nose pointed and cold and his lips resting on Sirius’ frantically beating jugular. The rapid rise and fall of Remus’ chest pressed against Sirius’ side, his quick breaths blowing against his neck</p><p>“Are you out of breath?” Sirius smiled, and received a harsh jab in the ribs in response.</p><p>“In case you didn’t notice,” Remus wheezed, “My respiratory system is kind of fucked up.”</p><p>“No kidding. I was just getting started.”</p><p>“I didn’t come all this way just to get insulted.” Remus elbowed Sirius in the ribs anyway, and without wanting to, closed his eyes and pulled closer to Sirius.</p><p>“You’re not going to sleep now, are you?” But even to Remus, he sounded tired.</p><p>Remus smirked. “Are you objecting to sleeping with me?”</p><p>Sirius paused. “Well, you got me there.”</p><p>“Then shut up. Don’t ruin this by talking.”</p><p>“Rude!”</p><p>“You’re doing it again.”</p><p>Sirius’ mumbled “Fine,” was the last thing Remus heard before drifting off to a peaceful sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Monday PM</u>
</p><p>It was the last thing either of them expected to walk in on, but in hindsight, it probably made the most sense.</p><p>Remus had been fatigued when they first led him to the dorm room, so to find him curled up against Sirius on his bed was hardly illogical. But still, James had worded Peter up that maybe they should enter the dorm loudly, and very, very slowly.</p><p>Even their loud steps and barging in didn’t wake the pair, and James put it down to years of sharing a room with other people. Remus snored softly and for once Sirius was silent, not even fidgeting in his sleep, as he was want to do. His right arm was cradled awkwardly, looking isolated compared to the entangled legs and winding torsos so wrapped up in each other.</p><p>Peter closed the door carefully behind them, and as the lock clicked Remus’ brows furrowed. James and Peter stood dead in their tracks, but Remus just huffed in his sleep and nuzzled closer into Sirius’ neck. The boys let out their breaths.</p><p>“You just get your books and I’ll share with you in class,” James whispered, and Peter nodded. Exaggeratedly, he tiptoed over to his bed in the far left corner of the room, careful not to trip over the shoes, footballs, and books scattered on the floor.</p><p>Peter, always the ungraceful one, tripped several times and actually fell atop his bed when he reached it. It took all of James’ will to not fly across the room and strangle him, but the two sleeping boys did not stir.</p><p>With excruciating care, Peter sifted through his chest for his Maths textbook, and when he finally pulled it out triumphantly, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>“Shit,” Peter hissed, because without even opening the door, they knew who it was.</p><p>Sirius had skipped class this morning, and even worse, he had skipped English class.</p><p>The knock came again, only sharper, more impatient. James knew the longer they ignored her the worse her temper would be.</p><p>“There’s no point playing coy,” her voice snapped through the door. “I know the three of you are in there.”</p><p>Three, four, little difference, James thought, when they were all going to be killed anyway.</p><p>James took a deep breath, and with a reassuring nod from Peter, unlocked the door.</p><p>As the handle turned it only occurred to him then that maybe they should have woken them up first.</p><p>“Shit,” Peter said again as McGonagall entered their dorm room and scanned it for presence of Sirius Black.</p><p>“Afternoon, Professor,” James said cheerily, but her face did not soften.</p><p>“Excellent weather we’re having, yes?” Peter added.</p><p>But McGonagall had her eyes locked on the sleeping boys, who still stayed clutched together and, much to James’ chagrin, unconscious.</p><p>“Who is that?” McGonagall asked stonily.</p><p>“My cousin!” Peter exclaimed at the same time James said, “Our plumber!”</p><p>McGonagall raised an eyebrow, and James knew this to mean she was refraining from showing amusement.</p><p>“Mr Pettigrew’s cousin, who is also a plumber? Bit young, isn’t he?”</p><p>“He’s a prodigy,” James said emphatically.</p><p>“He’s clearly not that smart if he would think it a good idea to fall asleep in Sirius Black’s bed. On a school morning.”</p><p>“Prodigies aren’t always wise,” Peter said, “They can also be very naïve.”</p><p>“Only prodigies?” McGonagall asked, and James knew she was making fun of them.</p><p>“Should I, uh, wake them up, Professor?” James asked.</p><p>“Don’t bother, Mr Potter. I’ll do it.”</p><p>McGonagall, with her hands secured behind her back, slowly approached the boys on the bed. She went over to the side Sirius laid, and slowly brought her face down to his ear.</p><p>“Mr Black!” she said sharply, not loudly, but loud enough for Sirius to leap from the bed, causing Remus to go tumbling out on the other side. They both yelped, arms flailing, all the while McGonagall backed away slowly, a small smile playing on her lips.</p><p>From the floor, Remus swore viciously, having not seen McGonagall’s foreboding figure.</p><p>“Excuse me, but regardless of whether you are a student of mine or not, I would appreciate it if you didn’t swear.”</p><p>Remus jumped again, leaping to his feet, and with his cheeks bright red sputtered out an apology.</p><p>Sirius also quickly scrambled to stand before his teacher, his cheeks just as red as Remus’.</p><p>“Morning, Professor,” he said, embarrassed.</p><p>“It is the afternoon, Mr Black,” she replied. “You seem to have slept through the morning.”</p><p>“Ah, what a shame.” Sirius ran his hand through his hand, a mannerism he adopted from James, only smoothing it down rather than ruffling it up. Remus just stood silently with his hands lost inside his sleeves, wringing out the hem of his jumper. “I was… um…”</p><p>McGonagall didn’t relent. “Preoccupied, I’m sure.”</p><p>Both Remus and Sirius’ faces became darker, which James didn’t know could be possible, and given the situation his cheeks nearly turned red too. This was painful.</p><p>Their head of house turned to Remus and asked, “What is your name?”</p><p>“Oh, um, Remus.” The room became silent, McGonagall waiting, and Remus sputtered out, “Lupin. I’m Remus Lupin.”</p><p>“What are you doing here, Mr Lupin?”</p><p>Remus’ words caught in his throat, so he just roughly jabbed his hand toward Sirius and said, “Him.”</p><p>Peter coughed, trying to disguise his laughter, and when Remus realized what he said he groaned and covered his face in his hands.</p><p>“I came here to see Sirius,” his voice muffled through his hands.</p><p>“Well, I see you found him,” McGonagall was openly smiling now, “But I’m afraid I must ask you to leave. Visitors need to sign in at the front office and wait until the student is available to be seen. This is usually during the allotted time for recess and lunch, so perhaps you should try again then. Until then, Mr Black is going to come with me to my office and we can discuss appropriate punishments for skipping my class this morning. Isn’t that right, Mr Black?”</p><p>“Yes, Professor,” Sirius grumbled.</p><p>“I’m sure Mr Potter and Mr Pettigrew will show you out, Mr Lupin. Just as they showed you in, I suppose.”</p><p>And with that, McGonagall left, trailing an embarrassed Sirius Black behind her.</p><p>“Well,” Peter said jovially in the awkward silence that followed, “Guess we’ll lead you out.”</p><p>Remus wouldn’t look either of them in the eye all the way to the gate.</p><p>*</p><p>(8:42) <em>I got my phone back.</em></p><p>(8:43) <strong>Miracles do occur!!!</strong></p><p>(8:45) <em>I had to endure three hour long lectures from each parents before it was given back to me…</em></p><p>(8:45) <strong>That’s understandable, considering that you ran away.</strong></p><p>(8:46) <em>I did not!

</p><p>(2:05) <em>I’ve got something for you.</em></p><p>(2:06) <strong>Now isn’t the time, Moons. I’m with the scary lady.</strong></p><p>(2:07) <em>I thought she was the love of your life?</em></p><p>(2:07) <em>No, that doesn’t matter. I’m helping.</em></p><p>(2:08) <em>The Importance of Attending Class</em></p><p>
  <em>Foreword by: Remus Lupin</em>
</p><p>
  <em>School is an important part of society. Without education we would not have a developing country, would not have the advance scientific knowledge that we have, would not have the iPhone. Had Tim Cook, a famous gay, not been educated appropriately to take over the corporate void that is Apple Inc., then we would not be the droning slaves of technology that we are. We owe it all to Cook.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius Black, likewise a famous gay, although his fame can be more attributed to infamy than anything, will become an important part to the technological Hellspace when he builds the writer robotic lungs. It fills the writer with such great regret that he took Mr Black away from a place that could contribute to this creation.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The writer imparts his deepest apologies, full of honest sincerity and empathy, as his home-schooling experience knows the pain of not being able to avoid punishment for wrong doing. I will continue to do my best to attend all classes at the kitchen table, and can vouch for Mr Black that he will also continue to attend each and every class until graduation (or else, and this is a personal promise to Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall from Remus John Lupin, Mr Black will find himself without a boyfriend willing to see him, severely disappointed at his jeapordising of robotic lungs).</em>

  <em>Now, on to the essay.</em>

I put my heart and soul into that foreword.</em></p><p>(3:16) <strong>I can tell she was amused, but only because I speak McGonagall. But also relieved that she didn’t have to deal with you for years.</strong></p><p>(3:18) <em>To be honest, I’m glad I don’t have to face her after our encounter.</em></p><p>(3:19) <strong>HA yeah. Moony, you fucked up.</strong></p><p>(3:20) <em>Shut up!! I was shocked!!</em></p><p>(3:21) <strong>You were scared shitless.</strong></p><p>(3:22) <em>That too. Mostly that.</em></p><p>(3:23) <strong>It’s completely understandable. I don’t blame you.</strong></p><p>(3:25) <em>Thank you. All the way to the front gate, Peter wouldn’t stop making fun of me.</em></p><p>(3:27) <strong>He was probably just glad it wasn’t him for once.</strong></p><p>(3:28)<strong> James is getting antsy without football practice. I’m getting him a treadmill for his birthday.</strong></p><p>(3:30) <em>Not one of those spinning wheels they put mice in?</em></p><p>(3:32) <strong>Nah, I’ll get one for Peter.</strong></p><p>(3:35) <strong>He’s dragging me outside to play for a bit.</strong></p><p>(3:36) <em>Have fun getting grass rash.</em></p><p>(3:37) <strong>I always do.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(6:13) <strong>It was raining.

We’re waiting for you, Prongs!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(9:50) <strong>James is hiding something and I’m going to find out what.</strong></p><p>(9:50) <em>That’s nice dear.</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>He’s sneaking out with other people.

The point is now that I’m going to talk to her.</strong></p><p>(9:18) <em>And say what?</em></p><p>*</p><p>(9:30) <strong>I asked her if she was a part of the group pulling all of these pranks.</strong></p><p>(9:31) <em>That’s… straight to the point.</em></p><p>(9:32) <strong>She denied everything.</strong></p><p>(9:33) <em>Of course. Your interrogating leaves much to be desired.</em></p><p>(9:35) <strong>I confronted her about catching her in the act.</strong></p><p>(9:36) <em>Please choose your words carefully.</em></p><p>(9:37) <strong>The squid!! Come on, Moony.</strong></p><p>(9:38) <em>And?</em></p><p>(9:40) <strong>She denied that, too.</strong></p><p>(9:50) <em>Well, what a surprise.</em></p><p>(9:54) <strong>She used that tone of voice, though.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>What tone of voice?</em></p><p>(9:56) <strong>The ‘I’m saying that I have no idea what you’re talking about but really I do’ tone of voice.</strong></p><p>(9:59) <em>That’s an oddly specific tone of voice.</em></p><p>(10:01) <strong>Come on, you know what I’m talking about, right?</strong></p><p>(10:04) <em>I’m sorry Padfoot, but I can’t say that I do.</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>If that was you trying to use that tone it didn’t really work, since this is texting.</strong></p><p>(10:06) <em>But you managed to pick up that I WAS using the tone through the text.</em></p><p>(10:07) <strong>This is getting off topic! I need a bribe, or blackmail…</strong></p><p>(10:09) <em>No blackmailing! Illegal!</em></p><p>(10:10) <strong>Buzz kill.</strong></p><p>(10:14) <em>I’m not busting you out of jail again.</em></p><p>(10:15) <strong>There it is, the jail joke.</strong></p><p>(10:16) <em>No blackmailing.</em></p><p>(10:17) <strong>Fine, fine! No blackmailing! … But bribery is fine?</strong></p><p>(10:19) <em>If you have something worth giving…</em></p><p>(10:20) <strong>I have Pokemon trading cards.</strong></p><p>(10:21) <em>I don’t think that’s going to cut it.</em></p><p>(10:25) <strong>Who knows? Dorcas could be a closet Pokemon fan.</strong></p><p>(10:36) <em>Everyone is a Pokemon fan, Sirus. I just don’t think it’s a fair trade.</em></p><p>(10:37) <strong>Well, I’ll think of something. Eventually. Until then I guess I’ll just keeping listening to Never Gonna Give You Up.</strong></p><p>(10:38) <em>It’s still playing?</em></p><p>(10:39) <strong>You bet! It never stopped!

I already know those lines.</em></p><p>(10:10) <strong>Yeah. It stopped playing when the school day finished.</strong></p><p>(10:11) <strong>Moony, that’s six hours. Six hours of Rick.</strong></p><p>(10:11) <strong>I’ve lost my mind.</strong></p><p>(10:12) <em>And you had to punish me too?</em></p><p>(10:13) <strong>I had to get it out of me, before it festered and corrupted my soul</strong>.</p><p>(10:14) <em>First, your hair would turn ginger.</em></p><p>(10:15) <strong>But then I’d get some cool glasses.</strong></p><p>(10:16) <em>And then… a striped shirt? My memory of the video clip is fading.</em></p><p>(10:16) <strong>I’d watch it to continue this joke but I don’t want to have to listen to the song again.</strong></p><p>(10:19) <em>That's reasonable. I also don’t want to be tormented again.</em></p><p>(10:20) <em>I’d have nightmares, probably.</em></p><p>(10:21) <strong>Probably. Don’t worry, I’ll be here to get through them with you.</strong></p><p>(10:22) <em>That would be comforting if you weren’t also the cause.</em></p><p>(10:24) <strong>Let’s just forget that part.

  <u>Thursday AM</u>
</p><p>(9:43) <em>Does James wear gold or silver jewellery?</em></p><p>(9:44) <strong>Uh</strong></p><p>(9:45) <strong>So far he only wears a friendship bracelet I made him in first year so. Yellow and red jewellery?</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>You made him a friendship bracelet? That’s so cute.</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>Yeah, yeah. I made James’, James made Peter’s, and Peter made mine. Bffs forever.</strong></p><p>(9:49) <em>So cute. So he has no preference?</em></p><p>(9:51)<strong> Moony, I’m gonna say that if you get him a Ben 10 watch that he’d be happy.</strong></p><p>(9:55) <em>I don’t think mum will find that very amusing.</em></p><p>(9:56) <em>Apparently watches are very important.</em></p><p>(9:58) <strong>They’re good for telling the time</strong>.</p><p>(10:04) <em>Mum has decided on silver, gold might be a bit too outlandish.</em></p><p>(10:06) <strong>Outlandish is James’ middle name.</strong></p><p>(10:06) <strong>Ok no it’s not, it’s Fleamont.</strong></p><p>(10:09) <em>You think up the weirdest names</em>.</p><p>(10:10)<strong> I’m not lying, for once.</strong></p><p>(10:11) <em>What?</em></p><p>(10:13) <strong>His middle name is Fleamont. After his dad.</strong></p><p>(10:14) <em>Oh my God. Please don’t tell him I called his name weird.</em></p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>[Devil’s Stag was added to the conversation]</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>(10:15) <strong>Moony said your middle name was weird.</strong></p><p>(10:15) <em>Hey! What did I just say!</em></p><p>(10:16) Don’t worry mate, it fuckin’ is.</p><p>(10:18) <em>It’s very unique.</em></p><p>(10:20) My mum had to add it onto the birth certificate when dad wasn’t looking. He was against the idea.</p><p>(10:21) <strong>Can’t say I blame him. Why further curse a child? Especially one so ugly and full of secrets?</strong></p><p>(10:23) I’m going to make you high five my Bunsen burner in a minute.</p><p>(10:25) <em>James do you prefer gold or silver?</em></p><p>(10:26) GOLD.</p><p>(10:29) <strong>Wow, what a shocker, coming from the wealthy kid.</strong></p><p>(10:31) Said the rich kid to the other.</p><p>(10:32) <em>You honestly prefer gold?</em></p><p>(10:33) Hell yeah! King Midas had the right idea.</p><p>(10:33) Why do you ask?</p><p>(10:34) <strong>Some might say that gold is a bit outlandish.</strong></p><p>(10:35) Suits me perfectly then, hm?</p><p>(10:35) <strong>That’s what I thought.</strong></p><p>(10:36) <em>Brilliant. I’ll make a note of it.</em></p><p>(10:37) For when?</p><p>(10:37) <em>Your funeral. I’m thinking a gold casket.</em></p><p>(10:38) That’s pretty cool, actually. I’ll accept that.</p><p>(10:38) <strong>I want a gold casket!</strong></p><p>(10:39) Padfoot, you’re most likely going to end up as a body dump.</p><p>(10:40) <em>He’s right. If I’m not the one murdering you, it’ll probably be him.</em></p><p>(10:40) <strong>Or one of my cousins. I think they’d happily do it.</strong></p><p>(10:41) Is that was Reg said?</p><p>(10:41) <strong>More or less.</strong></p><p>(10:42) Hey! Moony, you’re coming tonight, right? Sirius said you were but I think he said that before he even told you about it.</p><p>(10:43) <em>That sounds like something he would do. Yes, I am coming. What time?</em></p><p>(10:44) Mum reckons she’ll be finished preparing by seven, so anywhere after that.</p><p>(10:44) <strong>Preparing what?</strong></p><p>(10:44) You know Mum. A buffet of sorts.</p><p>(10:45) Moony, you allergic to anything?</p><p>(10:45) <em>No, I’m all good.</em></p><p>(10:46) <em>Alright, I have to go. See you later James!</em></p><p>(10:46) Cya mate!</p><p>(10:47) <strong>Aw, no good bye for me?</strong></p><p>(10:47) <em>Nah.</em></p><p>(10:48) Get rekt.</p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Thursday PM</u>
</p><p>(5:35) <em>So, is it casual wear?</em></p><p>(5:39) <strong>Nah, obviously the Potters have a strict dress code. Nothing less than a tux.</strong></p><p>(5:41) <em>But mine’s still in the drycleaners from my last attendance of an 18<sup>th</sup> birthday party.</em></p><p>(5:42) <strong>That was like two weeks ago.</strong></p><p>(5:42) <strong>Fire your drycleaners.</strong></p><p>(5:50) <em>But they do well at getting bloodstains out. And they don’t ask questions.</em></p><p>(5:52) <strong>Guess those sorts of drycleaners are hard to come by…</strong></p><p>(5:52) <strong>Still, they’re taking their sweet time.</strong></p><p>(5:53) <em>So what else can I wear to this engagement?</em></p><p>(5:54) <strong>Do you have a regular suit?</strong></p><p>(5:55)<em> I have one with a floral print.</em></p><p>(5:55) <em>Too outlandish, even for the Potters?</em></p><p>(5:56) <strong>Perhaps a bit. Might wanna tone it down.</strong></p><p>(5:58) <em>It’s either sweat pants or floral suit I’m afraid.</em></p><p>(5:59) <strong>Meet me in the middle. Sweat pants with the floral suit?</strong></p><p>(6:01) <em>I mean, it could work, but…</em></p><p>(6:02) <strong>But what?</strong></p><p>(6:03) <em>Well, as my date you’ll have to match.</em></p><p>(6:04) <strong>Who said I’m your date?</strong></p><p>(6:05) <em>No you’re right, I’m going to attend with Wormtail. I’ll ask him to match with me.</em></p><p>(6:07) <strong>Hang on, let’s not be hasty. I’ll be your date.</strong></p><p>(6:09) <em>Good. I need you to wear a sweater and dress pants.</em></p><p>(6:12)<strong> For balance. I see. I can do that.</strong></p><p>(6:15) <em>I’m pleased to hear that. I’ll see you later.</em></p><p>(6:18) <strong>See you later.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(7:35) <em>Hey, I think we’re at the right house? Come out the front.</em></p><p>(7:35) <strong>Ok.</strong></p><p>(7:35) <strong>Hey handsome</strong></p><p>Remus smiled, locking his phone before his mum could see the message on the screen, and turned in the passenger seat to give her a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>“Message me when it’s over – or, whenever you want to come home,” she said gently. “But not too late.”</p><p>Remus nodded, bid her a quick good bye and climbed out of the car.</p><p>The house wasn’t that big, which surprised Remus greatly, looking modestly humble in shrouds of clipped bushes sculptured like animals. As Remus followed the short ceramic tile path to the front door he could spot a lion, an eagle, and a badger trimmed from the hedges.</p><p>When he reached Sirius, he turned back to wave his mum off, and Sirius waved too. Remus’ mum smiled at them, and pulled out onto the road.</p><p>“She hates me, doesn’t she?” Sirius said and Remus couldn’t help but laugh at his worried tone.</p><p>“’Course not,” Remus reassured him, before changing the topic. “I’d hate to ask the obvious, but what’s with the hedges?”</p><p>Sirius blinked at him, then looked at the front yard as if seeing it for the first time. “Oh, the animals?”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“It’s a hobby of Mr Potter’s. He’s doing a snake next. They’re the, uh, mascots for each of the houses at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Sirius opened the front door for him, a stream of soft music and warmth hitting his body as he stepped in. The floors were carpeted, and a bundle of shoes were set at the front door. Remus took the initiative and slipped off his shoes.</p><p>“That’s a lot of pride for your son’s school,” Remus commented.</p><p>Sirius shrugged. “Mum and Dad Potter went to Hogwarts too. So did my parents. A lot of the same families go there.”</p><p>Remus hadn’t asked how many people would be there, and he started to regret not having the foresight as he stepped into the Potter’s lounge room and was immediately struck by the surmounting bodies huddled on and hanging over the couch and arm chairs.</p><p>He recognised some of them from the football match, especially taking note of the flaming orange heads he knew too well, but there were a few faces that were new. Remus hardly had time to even process them before James and Peter were launching from their seats at him.</p><p>“Moony!” Peter bellowed, but James reached him first and patted him so roughly on the back that he couldn’t help but cough.</p><p>“Sorry mate,” James said, but he smiled through the words, not at all looking sorry.</p><p>“Happy birthday,” Remus said, handing over the carefully wrapped present. James looked genuinely surprised, looked like he was about to protest before Remus cut in, “Of course I would buy you a birthday present, when I’ve been invited to your birthday party, on your birthday.”</p><p>“Right.” James ruffled the back of his head sheepishly, then tore into the present. He shouted when he saw what it was, suddenly punching Remus in the arm.</p><p>“What the hell!” Remus rubbed the sore spot on his arm.</p><p>“Now I know why the weird question about silver or gold,” James replied. He tossed the torn paper onto the coffee table and tried to tackle putting the watch on by himself and failing miserably. Remus took the watch from him impatiently, clipping it on quickly and setting the face of the watch to look up. James admired it, twisting his wrist to watch it glitter in the light, a broad smile on his face.</p><p>“Now you’ll have to learn how to read clocks,” Sirius joked.</p><p>James waved a hand. “Nah, that’s Peter who doesn’t know.”</p><p>Peter looked startled at his sudden inclusion in the conversation, crossing his arms over his chest. “It’s hard, I’ll have you know.”</p><p>James rolled his eyes. “Sure,” he said. “I’ll introduce you, Remus. Come on.”</p><p>Remus stepped out from under the precipice of the hallway and the lounge room, blindly searching for Sirius’ hand behind him. Remus liked meeting new people, even if sometimes the experience wasn’t always pleasant – always full of pity, soft eyes and hushed voices as if he were already dead – but the comfort of having Sirius there was calming, and he felt that calm wash through him when Sirius linked his fingers between his.</p><p>Remus expected to be introduced to each person one by one, but when James stopped in the middle of the middle and shouted, “This is Remus! Say hi!” Remus was not prepared for all of the eyes to be fixed on him, to have a chorus of greetings directed at him. He waved shyly as James threw his arm around his shoulders, beginning to point out people sitting on the couch and naming them.</p><p>“You know Lily, then that’s Marlene, and Dorcas, and Mary –”</p><p>“Oh, we’ve met,” Mary cut in. She winked at him as she blew a bubble between her lips, letting it pop and stick to her chin.</p><p>“Right,” James said, “I probably don’t want to know.”</p><p>“Probably not,” Sirius assured him.</p><p>Dorcas had only looked up long enough to acknowledge him, waving her hand minutely, then looking back down at the DS in her hands and furiously clicking buttons. Marlene watched her play, chin resting on Dorcas’ shoulder, but lifted her head to talk to Remus.</p><p>“Hey, hey,” she said. “Think I saw you at the game.”</p><p>“I remember,” Remus said. “Nice to see you again.”</p><p>Marlene raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, you too, to be honest. Wouldn’t do well to have Sirius sulk before finals.”</p><p>“There’s still time,” Dorcas said, not looking up from her game.</p><p>“Talk about wishing the best for me,” Sirius mumbled.</p><p>One orange head, previously hanging over the back of the couch to watch whatever Dorcas was playing, looked up at them and smiled.</p><p>“We’ve already lost our chance at the grand final,” one of the Prewetts – Remus didn’t know which one – said. “What else could he sulk about?”</p><p>Mary turned on the couch to face him. “Just wondering, Fab, but are you visually impaired?”</p><p>Fabian waved a hand on front of his face. “Don’t look like it.”</p><p>“Right,” Mary said sardonically. “Just checking.”</p><p>“Anyway,” James cut in quickly, “That’s Fabian, Gideon is next to him, and the little twitchy guy is Barty.”</p><p>Remus definitely remembered Barty, especially his stricken face after he got a foul against Goyle in that football match on the match point, but now he looked a lot calmer, with more colour in his face.</p><p>But Remus couldn’t help but agree with James’ description. Barty was twitchy.</p><p>“Hey,” he said, walking around the couch to shake Remus hand, and continued to shake his hand as he said, “Nice to meetcha, real nice.”</p><p>“You too,” Remus said tepidly. He carefully extracted his hand from Barty’s grip.</p><p>“Well, that’s the gang,” James said. “Come to the kitchen and see Mum.”</p><p>James led him through the lounge room, Sirius still gripping his hand and following behind, and they stepped through double swinging doors. Remus could feel the coolness of the kitchen tiles through the hole in his sock, the rest of the kitchen radiating coolness from the marble counter tops and windowed cupboards.</p><p>Mrs Potter bustled around the kitchen island, adorned with a platter and various finger foods, while Mr Potter followed behind his wife and whispered words that Remus could not hear.</p><p>“Mum,” James said to draw her attention. “You’re not freaking out again, are you?”</p><p>“Definitely not,” Mrs Potter replied, but her strained expression said otherwise.</p><p>“This is plenty, darling,” Mr Potter told her quietly, almost so quietly that Remus barely heard him.</p><p>“Is it really?” Mrs Potter fretted. She turned to her son, catching sight of Remus almost hiding behind him, and changed from worried to a beaming smile. She looked much like James, Remus suddenly thought, and instinctively braced himself as she approached him and pulled him into a tight embrace.</p><p>“Hello,” Remus said dazedly when she pulled back.</p><p>“Good to see you, dear,” Mrs Potter said, then took his arm and pulled him over to the kitchen island. “Now tell me, does this look like enough food? Would this be enough for you?”</p><p>“Mum,” James groaned.</p><p>Remus spluttered, tripping over his words because yes, there was plenty to eat, too much even, Remus couldn’t imagine how they would manage to get through it all in one evening.</p><p>Mrs Potter looked over Remus’ shoulder. “Sirius, what do you think?”</p><p>“Think it’s heaps,” Sirius said. “I’ll revel in the stomach ache it gives me.”</p><p>Mrs Potter whacked his head with her ovenmit. “Don’t eat too much. I don’t want to hear that you missed another class.”</p><p>Remus instantly felt guilty, but Sirius laughed. “Promise, I promise.”</p><p>“Good. James, get back to the living room, you can’t just leave your guests.”</p><p>“Yes, Mum,” James droned good-naturedly, and the three of them went back into the lounge room.</p><p>Peter had set up the old Nintendo 64 sitting under the wide screen television, already starting up Mario Kart and giving a controller to Gideon, Fabian and Lily.</p><p>“Round Robin style,” Peter said to them. “Winner gets to continue to the next game, and losers have to hand their controller over to the next person in line. First to win five games in a row is declared the ultimate winner. Sirius, Remus, you in?”</p><p>Lily had already picked her player – Princess Peach – and was waiting impatiently for the other boys to begin.</p><p>“Answer him quickly,” she said. “I’m ready to win.”</p><p>“I’m gonna show Moony around the house first,” Sirius said, then turned to Remus. “If that’s ok?”</p><p>Remus sighed in relief. “Yes. I actually really need to pee.”</p><p>Sirius laughed and dragged him back out into the hallway, past the kitchen this time, and pointed to the doors as they passed and named them.</p><p>“That’s the study, Mrs Potter uses it and all of the books are in there. This is Mr and Mrs Potter’s bedroom, I’ve been in there once and it was strange.”</p><p>Remus stopped walking and looked at Sirius quizzically. “Why was it strange?”</p><p>Sirius looked at him like it was obvious. “Because it's the parents’ bedroom. That’s, like, off limits.”</p><p>“I often sit in on my parents’ bed. There’s good lighting for reading in there.”</p><p>Sirius huffed. “Guess it must have been a Black thing,” he said absently. “Anyway.”</p><p>The bathroom was next, with pale blue floor tiles and basin, and blissfully a toilet.</p><p>Sirius’ and James’ bedrooms were at the back of the house, near the backdoor to the garden. Sirius briefly opened James’ bedroom door, showing Remus only a quick sight of his mess of a bed, then dragged Remus over to the next room.</p><p>“And this is my room!” Sirius told him excitedly, throwing open the door and making a sweeping gesture for Remus to step in.</p><p>It was a very simple room, although that hardly surprised Remus. The entire house was modestly minimal, not boasting of their wealth, and Sirius would only be spending a small portion of his year in this bedroom. It was mostly bare, for Remus assumed all of his stuff was strewn across his dorm room floor, but posters and photographs were blu-tacked to the wall above his bed.</p><p>A desk was pressed against the wall, under a window that overlooked the backyard. Various trinkets and mechanical parts lay on the top, the dark wood of the desk stained with motor oil.</p><p>“Used to be the guest room so it’s not that flash,” Sirius said nervously. “Even before I lived here, I just slept on James’ floor.”</p><p>Remus inspected the posters, shots of motorbikes and cars, some slick with fresh paint while others were taken apart, their insides bared and labelled.</p><p>“It’s very you,” Remus said, indicating to the pictures.</p><p>Sirius shrugged. “If all else fails, mechanic is still an option.”</p><p>Remus had to climb onto the bed to look at the photographs above the headboard. There was a succession of group shots, Sirius and James with Peter in the middle, starting from their first year of school to the previous year. Remus was struck by the glorious smile on Sirius’ face, in each and every photo, his true pleasure of being there with his friends.</p><p>“These are nice photos,” Remus said.</p><p>Sirius got onto the bed, shuffling up beside Remus to look at them too. “We haven’t taken this year’s yet. But, yeah. I like them.”</p><p>Sirius had a kind of dreamy smile on his face, one that told Remus he couldn’t quite believe his luck, having such close friends that loved him. Remus leaned over and kissed his cheek, snapping Sirius back to reality.</p><p>“You’re sappy,” Sirius said with a broad smile.</p><p>“We’ve been over this,” Remus replied, ducking down to kiss his other cheek.</p><p>Sirius playfully slapped him away, a giveaway smile on his face as he shuffled down to the other end of the bed. Remus followed, swinging his legs over the edge and knocking his feet against Sirius’.</p><p>“It’s a good home,” Remus said lightly as they began wrestling with each other’s feet. “Better than your dorm, at least.”</p><p>Sirius laughed. “Well, that’s not very hard. But thanks. It’s home here.”</p><p>Remus felt light. He felt like a soft calm had wrapped around him, simply by being this close to Sirius, in a space that was intricately Sirius. Sirius, too, looked like he was floating, radiating an aura of peacefulness that Remus got sucked into. Their own quiet bubble.</p><p>As Remus thought, he lowered his head to kiss Sirius’ shoulder, trailing along to the crook of his neck before he stopped. He had an idea.</p><p>“Hey,” Remus asked gently, prodding Sirius’ shoulder, “Can I see it?”</p><p>“See what?” Sirius replied slyly. Remus whacked him over the head.</p><p>“Your tattoo. Can I see it? I’ve only seen the picture. It’s healed, right?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Sirius said easily. “Ok. Hang on.”</p><p>Remus didn’t know why he didn’t anticipate this. He knew, on some level, that clothing would need to be rearranged so he could see it, but he just didn’t expect the entirety of Sirius’ bare back to be in the picture, having grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled it up to his neck. His shoulders were exposed too, which was the main goal, but even at the front Sirius’ shirt had ridden up over his abdomen.</p><p>Remus’ cheeks felt very hot. This was not where he was planning on things going.</p><p>“You looking?” Sirius asked and for a moment Remus forgot what he was meant to be looking at.</p><p>
  <em>Tattoo. Right.</em>
</p><p>Remus huffed. “I’m looking, alright.”</p><p>Sirius shot him a smirk over his shoulder, and that’s when Remus saw it.</p><p>The phoenix was a brilliant blaze of orange, red, and yellow, flames licking up its feathery tail as it soared across his shoulder blade. The colours mingled together in swirls and flicks, Remus tracing its pattern with the tip of his finger.</p><p>“Shit,” he whispered. “Sorry, didn’t mean to do that.”</p><p>Sirius shook his head, the ends of his dark hair tickling the phoenix. “Keep going if you want, it’s fine. You’d be surprised by how many people have the urge to touch tattoos.”</p><p>His voice was quiet, and Remus couldn’t see his face through the jungle of his long hair. He wondered how often people touched Sirius like this, gentle and caring, as if his skin would pierce under the slightest point. Remus slid his fingers over the tattoo again, following the phoenix’s back to the tip of its beak.</p><p>“A phoenix,” Remus said quietly. “Very symbolic.”</p><p>“Rising from the ashes. Brand new start.” His shoulder jolted in a shrug. “Yeah, I know.”</p><p>Remus pressed his hand flat against Sirius’ back, his fingers splayed. The tattoo wasn’t much bigger than his hand, the skin underneath his palm quite warm.</p><p>He dragged his hand down slowly, his thumb smoothing over the bumps and ridges of Sirius’ spine. Sirius straightened his back as Remus got lower, watching over his shoulder as Remus curved his hand around and pressed against his stomach. Remus leaned in and kissed the phoenix, pulling Sirius closer against him.</p><p>“You just wanted an excuse to feel me up,” Sirius said, leaning his head back against Remus’ chest.</p><p>Remus smoothed the hair away from Sirius’ face to look at him, then shrugged in response. “You’re the one who practically stripped in front of me.”</p><p>Sirius hummed in agreement. “I should put this back on before someone walks in and gets the wrong idea.”</p><p>“Jee, and what idea would that be?” Remus joked as Sirius struggled to pull his arm back into the shirt.</p><p>“That you tricked me into doing something scandalous,” Sirius replied.</p><p>“I’m sure they’d believe you, too,” Remus said sarcastically.</p><p>Once Sirius had sorted out his shirt, they quietly slipped back into the lounge room. The game had been paused as food was set out on the coffee table in the middle of the room, but Lily held her controller protectively in her lap.</p><p>“I’m on my third win,” she told Sirius when they came in.</p><p>“Already?” Sirius said incredulously. “We’re gonna have to disqualify you from these competitions.”</p><p>“That’s not fair,” said a dark girl from the couch, Remus already forgetting her name. She shovelled potato chips into her mouth as she spoke, “Lily has been practicing non-stop to even match the level you guys are on at this game.”</p><p>“Really?” James asked and he sounded a little proud.</p><p>“Competitive by nature,” Lily said happily. “Plus, dorming with Dorcas will have that effect on you.”</p><p>“Competitiveness?” Gideon asked.</p><p>“No.” Lily grinned. “Getting good at video games.”</p><p>“Thanks, Lils,” the girl from the couch said, and that’s when Remus remembered.</p><p>“Oh, you’re – you’re that Dorcas!” he exclaimed, immediately clapping a hand over his mouth before he could say anything else. The Dorcas that Sirius stalked to find out if you were a prankster.</p><p>“How many Dorcas’s do you know?” she said with a smirk. “And what do you mean by that?”</p><p>Remus felt the heat rising in his cheeks again, only this time it was more painful. “Oh. Uh, nothing.”</p><p>“You’re the Dorcas that Sirius took out on a date,” Peter informed her mischievously, effectively saving Remus from great embarrassment.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about that,” Marlene cut in, throwing a protective arm over Dorcas’ shoulders.</p><p>“I agree,” Dorcas said as she snuggled in closer to Marlene. “My taste has gotten better since then.”</p><p>Sirius laughed. “You realise that you also just insulted Remus.”</p><p>“I’m not insulted,” Remus said. “Just means I’m dating down.”</p><p>“Too right you are,” James added and Sirius flipped him the bird.</p><p>Remus was beginning to feel tired, slumping against Sirius’ side while the other boy talked animatedly with everyone in the room. Remus watched Dorcas continue to play her game, interjecting every now and then with a sarcastic comment or to whisper something to Marlene. She looked very placid, and Remus could imagine that she spent a lot of time sitting idly and playing games.</p><p>“She just doesn’t look like the kind of person to put a giant squid in a lake for kicks,” Remus murmured to Sirius.</p><p>“Oh, please,” Sirius sighed. “She spent all of second year firing spit balls at me. Dorcas is definitely a part of this counter-prankster business.”</p><p>“And Marlene?” Remus asked.</p><p>“Possibly. Wouldn’t put it past her. Their whole group, actually. Mary would love the sneaking out at night. They have another friend, Emmaline, who’s very smart. And Lily. Although I’ve ruled them out because I don’t think it would be Lily’s thing.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Sirius looked thoughtful as he formulated his answer. “She’s tricky, and can use the system to her advantage. Slughorn especially, he’s such a wimp. And she’s not above teasing. But pranks… They seem to be too childish for her.”</p><p>“So you agree?” Remus asked with a smile.</p><p>Sirius furrowed his brows. “Agree with what?”</p><p>“That pranks are childish.”</p><p>Sirius poked his tongue out at him as Remus laughed.</p><p>“I’m starting to think it’s some Hufflepuffs,” Sirius told him. “I’ll have to infiltrate their building to get more information.”</p><p>“Oh, my God,” Remus heard through the ambient noise of chatter. “Are you still talking about that?”</p><p>It was Mary, apparently listening into Sirius’ and Remus’ conversation.</p><p>“So what if I am?” Sirius asked defensively. “What’s it to you?”</p><p>“It’s hurting my ears,” Mary said bluntly. “Just give up already.”</p><p>“I will never give up!” Sirius proclaimed, jostling Remus as he threw his arms in the air.</p><p>“Wow, you weren’t kidding,” Remus heard Lily mutter to James, who just nodded sadly.</p><p>Remus turned to Mary, subtly elbowing Sirius in the ribs. “So, you’re saying you have no interest in finding out who these people are?” Remus asked her.</p><p>“None,” Mary said quickly.</p><p>“Not even a little curious?” Sirius added.</p><p>“Not even a little.”</p><p>“How about you, Dorcas?” Remus asked. “Personally, I think a fake squid in a lake was a bit weak.”</p><p>“The squid was good,” Dorcas said defensively, ruining her nonchalance by looking up from her game.</p><p>Sirius sighed wistfully. “When I find these people, I sure have a lot to teach them.”</p><p>“They don’t need your help,” Marlene told him. “They’re doing just fine.”</p><p>“You think so?” Remus tried to sound sceptical.</p><p>“Yes,” Mary piped up firmly, causing Sirius to grin widely.</p><p>“I thought you said you didn’t care about all this,” he said slyly.</p><p>“Oh, stop it!” Lily shouted suddenly. “Fine, can you keep a secret?”</p><p>“You know I can, Redhind,” Sirius said happily, leaning forward in his seat and grinning at her. Remus could tell by the look on her face that she had already regretted her outburst.</p><p>Lily pursed her lips, folding her arms over her chest and leaning back into James. “You already know what I’m going to tell you,” she said stubbornly.</p><p>“I’d like to hear you say it,” Sirius sing-songed.</p><p>“The rest of you have to swear an oath, too.” Lily turned around, pointing at each of the boys. Barty had a mouthful of finger foods shoved in his mouth, and apparently hadn’t been following the conversation, but agreed to stay silent.</p><p>“I swear on Gid’s life that I will not repeat what has been said here,” Fabian said with a hand over his heart.</p><p>“Bro, that’s a bit much,” his brother told him. “At least swear on Mols’ life.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna kill Molly,” Fabian shrieked. “If it came down to it, I’d rather it be you. She’d be scary as a ghost.”</p><p>“Fabian, are you already saying that you can’t keep this secret?” Lily asked. “Because if that’s the case, leave the room, please.”</p><p>Fabian looked thoughtful for a minute, then finally exited the room.</p><p>“He… actually did it,” Remus said in wonder. Sirius laughed.</p><p>“Fine, now that we’re all in agreement,” Lily sighed, “I’ll tell you, Sirius. Yes, we are what you have called ‘the counter-pranksters’.” Lily looked like she was swallowing glass just saying the name, the grimace on her face deepening as Sirius spoke.</p><p>“Tell me, specifically, who is in your little group of pranksters?”</p><p>Remus wondered how many times Sirius and Lily competed against each other, how many times they tried to best the other, because to Remus, Sirius sounded way too smug for the situation and Lily looked far too pained.</p><p>But it was Mary who cracked, groaning dramatically. “It’s me, Dorcas, Marls, and Lils. Happy?”</p><p>Remus didn’t think it was possible, but Sirius’ smile grew wider. “Very happy,” he said contently. “I knew it was you four all along.”</p><p>“No you didn’t.” Lily rolled her eyes. “Someone tell Fab he can come back in now.”</p><p>“Aw, are we done talking about it?” Sirius pouted.</p><p>“Yes,” Lily said evasively, and by then Fabian had come back into the room and Sirius dropped the subject.</p><p>Remus watched with mild amusement as Sirius sunk in his seat, shoving potato chips moodily into his mouth, and only brightening when James declared the Mario Kart tournament to be back on.</p><p>“Now,” he told Remus in confidence, “I take my revenge on Evans.”</p><p>Remus heard Lily snort from the other side of the room.</p><p>And so the tournament began.</p><p>*</p><p>“I can’t believe I lost,” Sirius said when the tournament finished.</p><p>Frankly, Remus could believe it a little, although he wasn’t really one to comment on the karting abilities of others. Just like his true-to-life driving skills, Remus acted on cautious and safe rather than speed, even though he knew nothing particularly catastrophic would happen if he were to crash.</p><p>“It’s something about the red shells,” Remus whined. “They scare me.”</p><p>“So you kept yourself in last place on purpose?” Sirius asked.</p><p>Remus had shrugged. He honestly preferred playing games on his own, or watching others play, but they had insisted that he have a turn. It was just his luck he was up against Lily and Dorcas, as well as Marlene, who was getting help from Dorcas.</p><p>Most of them had gone back to school once Lily was declared winner, only barely coming first to Dorcas. Remus sat on the Potters’ front step with Sirius, James, Peter and Lily, waiting for his mum to show up before they headed back to school too.</p><p>“We’ll have to have a rematch during the summer,” Sirius decided.</p><p>The cool breeze of the night tore right through Remus, so he huddled in closer to Sirius who threw his arm around him seemingly without thought.</p><p>“Or we could try a new game,” Peter suggested hopefully.</p><p>James smirked at him. “Like what?”</p><p>“Snap,” he said. “You know, the card game.”</p><p>“Ah,” Sirius said knowingly, “You mean the game that’s entirely up to chance and not skill?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Peter replied glumly.</p><p>“Hey, I like that.” James’ eyes were alight with an idea, twinkling in the starlight and with excitement. “We can tape some bang-snaps to the cards so when you snap the card it pops. We’ll call it Exploding Snap.”</p><p>“Bang snaps?” Remus asked.</p><p>“Novelty fireworks,” Sirius explained. “They won’t hurt you. They’re the things that make party poppers pop.”</p><p>Remus shook his head. “Well, I look forward to setting your house on fire this summer, James.”</p><p>“Oh, it’ll be fine.” James waved him off. “They’re tiny and held inside paper that doesn't catch on fire. Lils, you in?”</p><p>“And no cheating,” Sirius cut in before she could say anything. “No practicing snap with Dorcas.”</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. “I’m in. Winner gets to snap a card on Sirius’ face.”</p><p>“Deal,” James said while Sirius squawked indignantly.</p><p>“And if I win?” he asked.</p><p>There was silence filled in only by actual crickets, much to Remus’ amusement, as Sirius grew grumpier by each passing second.</p><p>“I’ll show you all,” he said, subconsciously pulling Remus in closer. “I’ll win at Exploding Snap.”</p><p>Remus patted him on the knee reassuringly and kissed him on the cheek. “Sure, love.”</p><p>Sirius’ warm hand folded over his just as a set of headlights blared into their eyes. Remus had to squint to make out the dark silhouette of one of his parents in the driver’s seat, but even then he couldn’t be sure which one it was.</p><p>He said goodbye to everyone as he stood, Sirius standing with him and kissing him quickly on the lips in farewell. Remus smiled, squeezed his hand before walking to the car and slipping into the passenger’s seat.</p><p>“So, that’s him,” his dad greeted him.</p><p>“Yep,” Remus said lightly.</p><p>His father just nodded, honking the horn at the group of teenagers and waving before pulling out of the driveway.</p><p>Remus fell asleep on his way home.</p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Friday AM</u>
</p><p>(10:03) <strong>What a wild night, huh?</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>I’m just so exhausted from all the craziness.</em></p><p>(10:04) <strong>The Potters really know how to put on a party.</strong></p><p>(10:05) <em>It was nice, though.

I was co-conspirator to revealing her darkest secret.</em></p><p>(10:11) <strong>That’s just mild character flaw.

  <u>Friday PM</u>
</p><p>(3:54) <strong>I don’t mean to alarm anyone but there’s a pig in our hall?</strong></p><p>(3:56) That’s Miss Piggy.</p><p>(3:57) <strong>Oh, of course.

They were kind enough to donate them.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>[Re-Moo was added to the conversation]</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>(4:09) <strong>They have released pigs into the halls, Moony.</strong></p><p>(4:10) <em>That’s a classic prank.</em></p><p>(4:11) <u>But why are they numbered?</u></p><p>(4:12) When Dumbledore collects them and finds that they can’t find the pig labeled number 4.</p><p>(4:13) <u>Ah, I get it.

I will gladly take credit.</strong></p><p>(4:17) Stop mooching off my girlfriend’s success!</p><p>(4:18) <strong>I wouldn't have to mooch if someone paid attention to me!</strong></p><p>(4:19) Alright Sirius, what would you like to do?</p><p>(4:20) <strong>I’d like to fry up one of these pigs, to be honest.</strong></p><p>(4:20) No! Do not cause the pigs harm!</p><p>(4:21) <strong>I’ll eat it up. Pork, ham, bacon, I’ll even eat the hoof.</strong></p><p>(4:22) <u>They’re not hoofs. Horses have hoofs!</u></p><p>(4:22) <u>Hoofs?

If you eat one of those pigs, Marlene will eat you.</p><p>(4:32) <strong>Yeah, I’d rather not.</strong></p><p>(4:33) Exactly.

About Lily, mostly.</em></p><p>(10:01) <strong>Rest assured that that’s all over now.</strong></p><p>(10:02) <em>Oh?</em></p><p>(10:02) <strong>Yeah, James was telling me that the pranking thing is like a ‘making up for lost time’ thing.</strong></p><p>(10:03) <em>How so?</em></p><p>(10:03) <strong>Lily used to have this friend in Slytherin, but he was a greasy little slimeball. She says he tried to tell her what she could and couldn’t do, who she could and couldn't talk to.</strong></p><p>(10:04) <em>That doesn’t sound healthy.</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>It’s not. She finally dropped him at the start of the semester and just wants to have some fun before going to uni.</strong></p><p>(10:06) <em>That’s reasonable.</em></p><p>(10:08) <strong>Yeah. Still trying to convince her to collaborate with me though.</strong></p><p>(10:09) <em>Good luck on that.</em></p><p>(10:10) <strong>Thanks. I’ll need it.</strong></p><p>(10:13) <em>I’m drifting off to sleep now.</em></p><p>(10:14) <strong>Ready and excited for tomorrow?</strong></p><p>(10:15) <em>I can’t be excited for something I don’t know about.

</p><p>(9:00) <strong>Good morning, Moony!</strong></p><p>(9:00) <em>Fuck offffffffff</em></p><p>(9:01) <strong>Alright, see ya later!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(11:32) <em>That was rude and inappropriate.</em></p><p>(11:35) <strong>Just some harmless fun!</strong></p><p>(11:36) <em>Was not harmless. You hurt my heart.</em></p><p>(11:37) <strong>Shall I make it up to you?</strong></p><p>(11:39) <em>Depends. How are you planning on doing that?</em></p><p>(11:40) <strong>Be ready to go by 1.</strong></p><p>(11:41) <em>Oh God</em></p><p>(11:41) <em>Ok, yes. Ok.</em></p><p>(11:42) <strong>Excellent! See you soon!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Saturday PM</u>
</p><p>(1:08) <strong>I’m outside your place. Didn’t know if I should knock…</strong></p><p>(1:08) <em>It’s fine. I’ll be out in a second.</em></p><p>*</p><p>Sirius waited nervously, subconsciously hiding himself behind the Lupins’ front fence. The curtain shading the front window ruffles, a tiny balding head peaking out to have a look at him, and before Sirius knew what he was doing he fell to the ground and hid.</p><p>He was sure that was Mr Lupin. Unless he was gravely mistaken, and that Hope Lupin had some kind of condition that Remus didn’t tell him about. Regardless, it was one of the Lupin parents. One of the Lupin parents that probably didn’t like him.</p><p>He didn’t notice Remus watching him from the letter box, just standing silently until Sirius turned his head and jumped out of his skin.</p><p>“Moony!” Sirius shouted as Remus cackled.</p><p>“What are you doing?” he asked.</p><p>“Is your mum bald?” Sirius asked instead, peering over the fence to watch the front window. He could see the silhouette of a Lupin Parent, still unsure which one, as they remained behind the curtain this time.</p><p>“My mum isn’t bald,” Remus said. “You most likely saw my dad.”</p><p>“Bad omen for you,” Sirius tried to joke. “Premature balding is in store for you.”</p><p>“You look like a stalker,” Remus said flatly and lifted him bodily up from the ground. “Now take me to this mystery place.”</p><p>Sirius sprung into step, holding his hand out behind him for Remus to take. When his hand grabbed nothing but air he turned back to look at Remus, who was still laughing at Sirius’ hiding act. Sirius whined until Remus followed, taking his hand and allowing Sirius to lead them to Hogsmeade train station without a further word.</p><p>He hoped this was a good idea. He wasn’t even sure if Remus remembered, but watching him look happily out of the train window assured Sirius that it probably didn’t matter where they went, Remus would be pleased either way.</p><p>Probably less pleased if Sirius took him to the outskirts of Hogsmeade to visit the rubbish tip, but that wasn’t the plan, so Sirius felt fine about it.</p><p>The train ride itself was nice. Remus liked to point things out the window and tell an interesting fact about them, mostly types of trees and what birds liked to live there. Sirius had to bite his tongue from making fun, not wanting to scare Remus into silence, and listened with genuine interest as Remus talked about birds.</p><p>The train ride to Diagon Alley didn’t take long, but Sirius was still practically skipping with impatience and dragging Remus behind him.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Remus asked for what was probably the tenth time since they left his house.</p><p>“To have fun!” Sirius replied, as he had replied all the other times.</p><p>He doesn’t know why this was such a big deal to him. It would probably end up him appreciating the sentiment more than Remus, but there was something about this date in particular that made Sirius think he’d been waiting for it forever.</p><p>Like as soon as he heard about it, he wanted to be the one to take Remus there.</p><p>They were getting close now, Remus’ angry mumbling quieting as they turned a corner and made their way up broad, concrete steps, entering the building with the jaws of a great white shark as the front doorway.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Remus whispered as they stepped through the rows of teeth.</p><p>“Haven’t been recently, have you?” Sirius smirked at him. “I think they’ve got an Ancient Greece exhibition on at the moment – let’s go freak out over some pots!”</p><p>“Pots with naked men on them,” Remus added as they got to the ticket booth. “Don’t forget that part.”</p><p>“The most important part,” Sirius agreed. He paid for the tickets before Remus could protest, quickly grabbing his hand again and dragging him through the lobby. “But first, we have to look at the dinosaurs!”</p><p>Remus followed him easily through the museum, like Sirius knew he would.</p><p>*</p><p>If Sirius was held at gunpoint and forced to the tell the truth, then he would admit that he spent more time watching Remus looking at the exhibits than actually looking at the exhibits himself.</p><p>It wasn’t that he found them boring, per say, he just liked it much better when Remus would excitedly read out the information cards to him instead. He also liked it when Remus would add in his own information, and the way he’d stop in front of old documents to actually read them, and basically the entire trip was a giant Remus Exhibit for Sirius.</p><p>So far, it was his favourite.</p><p>Even if Remus did point to the Neanderthal mannequins and tell Sirius, “That’s you,” and doing the same with the disfigured taxidermy animals.</p><p>Even if Remus insisted on seeing the bug exhibit.</p><p>“We could just go into your garden,” Sirius whined. He didn’t exactly want to admit that the bugs creeped him out, another one of those admissions that would require a gun to the head, but he could already tell that Remus saw right through him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Padfoot. They’re all dead,” he replied, as they walked past three consecutive tanks containing very large, very alive spiders.</p><p>Yes, Remus was his favourite exhibit, even if he did tickle his fingers down Sirius’ neck while walking past the three consecutive tanks containing very large, very alive spiders, causing Sirius to scream bloody murder and even have five year old children look at him as if he were a big baby, and one security guard tell him to calm down or he’ll be kicked out.</p><p>“You’re wicked,” he hissed at Remus, who looked anything but remorseful.</p><p>“You’re jumpy.” Remus smirked. “Ants in your pants?”</p><p>“Not funny!”</p><p>But Sirius’ favourite part was the star gazing room, with the planets and constellations projected onto a dome ceiling, and Remus practically sat on his lap on one of the provided beanbags. His favourite part was when Remus looked away from the faux night sky and kissed him gently on the lips, words of thank you hushed in the air between them.</p><p>*</p><p>Sirius was, by now, well accustomed the Lupins’ front fence.</p><p>“Just ten minutes,” Remus said. “You can’t avoid them forever.”</p><p>Clutching to the baby blue picket fence, Sirius honestly considered just that.</p><p>“They don’t hate you,” Remus sighed.</p><p>“How would you know? You’re biased.”</p><p>“Am not.”</p><p>“You see what you want,” Sirius insisted.</p><p>Remus folded his arms over his chest. “What I see is my sorry excuse for a punk rock boyfriend cowering behind a fence because he doesn't want to meet the parents.”</p><p>His arse was starting to go numb from sitting on the hard ground for so long, but he made no effort to move.</p><p>“Isn’t it too soon in the relationship for this?” Sirius was grasping at straws, and once again, he knew Remus could see right through him.</p><p>“I’ve met the Potters. Your turn.”</p><p>Sirius pouted. “But the Potters like you.”</p><p>“And my parents will like you too, once they actually meet you. Don’t you want to fix your tarnished reputation?”</p><p>Sirius thought for a moment, slowly rising from the ground, keeping a hold onto the fence for support. “But I didn’t wear a tie.”</p><p>Remus smacked him over the head, but then took his hand and led him up the front path.</p><p>“Oh,” Remus remembered. “Pretend like you’ve never been here before. There’s only so much I can admit to before they send me away to live with my Uncle Alphard to learn proper manners.”</p><p>“Learning manners from Alphard sounds like a bad idea,” Sirius said.</p><p>He took a deep breath as Remus opened the front door, keeping the air in his lungs while he stepped through the threshold. Remus called out to his parents, telling them that Sirius had come in to say hello, and suddenly all of the air evaporated from Sirius’ chest.</p><p>“Shit,” he whispered, but Remus held on tight to his hand, a reassuring squeeze as a familiar bald head and its blonde partner came into view.</p><p>“Hello, Sirius,” Hope Lupin said pleasantly. Sirius had to let go of Remus to shake her hand. “Nice to finally meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>“P-pleasure to meet you too,” Sirius stuttered out and before he knew it Lyall Lupin was in front of him with his shiny bald head, and moustache turned up to a cautious smile.</p><p>“Sirius,” Lyall said gruffly.</p><p>“Sir,” he replied.</p><p>“You don’t plan on spending a life in crime, do you?” Lyall asked. Hope burst into laughter, smacking her husband on the shoulder and telling him to stop.</p><p>“No, sir,” Sirius said, still unsure whether he was joking or not.</p><p>“Well, that's disappointing,” Lyall replied. “There’s some money in the industry.”</p><p>“The… crime industry?”</p><p>Remus sighed. “Dad, stop messing with him.”</p><p>Lyall giggled, a high pitched sound that surprised Sirius, then patted Sirius roughly on the back.</p><p>“Couldn’t resist,” Lyall laughed. “He looks so scared.”</p><p>“Well, he was under the impression that you thought of him as a bad influence and a phase,” Remus said quite sternly.</p><p>Lyall stopped laughing, nodding to his son and turning back to Sirius. “Thank you for… looking after him.”</p><p>Sirius was taken aback. It wasn’t quite an apology, which Sirius didn’t even know if he deserved, but it was acceptance enough. It reassured him, at least, that Lyall was not going to be causing Remus anymore stress.</p><p>“No problem. You keep at it, too.”</p><p>“I will,” Lyall said sincerely, and wrapped an arm around Remus’ shoulder and jostled him playfully.</p><p>Sirius finally inhaled again.</p><p>*</p><p>(10:03) <em>This summer, I’ll take you to the beach.</em></p><p>(10:05) <strong>I do like long walks on the beach.</strong></p><p>(10:07) <em>Just as I like long walks at the museum.</em></p><p>(10:08) <strong>Yes, you do. I think my feet have permanent disfigurement from standing for so long.</strong></p><p>(10:11) <em>Says the athlete.</em></p><p>(10:12) <strong>Knowledge gives me allergies. I’m sick from the museum.</strong></p><p>(10:14) <em>And you suffered through it all, for me.</em></p><p>(10:16) <strong>Anything for you, love.</strong></p><p>(10:17) <em>Thank you. Today was a dream.</em></p><p>(10:19) <strong>It’s no problem. Anything for you, love.</strong></p><p>(10:21) <em>Good night, Sirius.</em></p><p>(10:22) <strong>Night, Remus.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Sunday MIDDAY</u>
</p><p>(12:42) <em>If you had anything that you wanted to say to me, it’s best you say it now.</em></p><p>(12:45) <strong>I secretly adore your dorky sweaters.</strong></p><p>(12:46)<em> Aw, thank you Padfoot.</em></p><p>(12:46) <strong>Wait, why am I telling you this?</strong></p><p>(12:48) <em>I’m currently in a car with Teen Tragic.</em></p><p>(12:48) <strong>Ok… have you lost your mind?</strong></p><p>(12:49) <em>Slightly. A lot. And soon my mind is going to be splattered on asphalt.</em></p><p>(12:51) <strong>Please, no. I also secretly adore your dorky mind.</strong></p><p>(12:52)<em> I’m in the backseat, so if there’s a front-on collision I think I’ll be ok.</em></p><p>(12:55) <strong>What possessed you to agree to this?</strong></p><p>(12:57) <em>The promise that I could sleep in.</em></p><p>(12:59) <em>Alice and I are going on a campus tour.</em></p><p>(1:04) <strong>Not Teen Tragic himself?</strong></p><p>(1:05) <em>He’s taking a gap year. Alice is interested in their occupational therapy course.</em></p><p>(1:06) <strong>And you?</strong></p><p>(1:08) <em>I … might be having a look at their education department.</em></p><p>(1:10) <strong>Good, Moony.</strong></p><p>(1:13) <em>Have you been looking at any universities?</em></p><p>(1:15) <strong>I’ve read through some websites and course guides and stuff. They all seem alright. I’ll probably go wherever James goes.</strong></p><p>(1:17) <em>Really?</em></p><p>(1:18) <strong>Yeah. Peter has already qualified for this online course he wants to do.</strong></p><p>(1:19) <strong>Oh, we plan on finding a share house together.</strong></p><p>(1:21) <em>After already living with them for so long?</em></p><p>(1:23) <strong>Yeah. We’re used to each other.</strong></p><p>(1:25) <em>Alice is looking to move out, too. She seems keen on a dorm on campus.</em></p><p>(1:28) <strong>And what about you?</strong></p><p>(1:30) <em>Alice only just presented the idea to me. I haven’t decided.</em></p><p>(1:31) <em>Alright, we’re here. Talk to you later.</em></p><p>(1:31) <strong>Glad you made it alive! Bye!</strong></p><p>*</p><p>
  <u>Sunday PM</u>
</p><p>(2:12) <em>There are so many lounge chairs. In such bright colours!</em></p><p>(2:20) <em>They have a room specifically for napping.</em></p><p>(2:44) <em>I may have already taken advantage of that room.</em></p><p>(2:52) <em>Someone just asked me if I’d like to join their basketball team. They said it didn’t matter when I told them I have a medical condition.</em></p><p>(3:01) <strong>Sorry, playing football.</strong></p><p>(3:01) <strong>So, did you join the basketball team?</strong></p><p>(3:03) <em>Goodness, no.</em></p><p>(3:04) <em>But it was so weird. They didn’t even bat an eyelid.</em></p><p>(3:06) <strong>The world is your oyster, Moony.</strong></p><p>(3:09) <em>The campus is nice. It’s a little big. It’s a bit overwhelming.</em></p><p>(3:10) <strong>I thought that about Hogwarts. It’ll look small in no time.</strong></p><p>(3:14) <em>I can also study education and disability education at the same time. Most other universities have disability education as an extra course.</em></p><p>(3:20) <strong>Sounds like you like it there, Moony.</strong></p><p>(3:22) <em>Yeah. Alice is quite interested, too.</em></p><p>(3:23) <strong>We’re getting something to eat. Talk to you later.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>(10:34) <em>My feet hurt, but like a good hurt.</em></p><p>(10:35) <strong>I’m surprised you’re still awake. I didn’t text you earlier because I thought you would be sleeping.</strong></p><p>(10:36) <em>We visited another campus but we didn’t like it as much. Just didn’t feel right.</em></p><p>(10:38) <strong>You mean you survived another trip with Teen Tragic?</strong></p><p>(10:39) <em>Shockingly, yes. We’re all surprised, but also proud.</em></p><p>(10:39) <em>I’m on Alice’s floor now. She’s already fallen asleep.</em></p><p>(10:40) <strong>Time you did too?</strong></p><p>(10:40) <em>Yeah. I’m still going to be dead tomorrow.</em></p><p>(10:41) <strong>But it’s a good tired.</strong></p><p>(10:43) <em>It is. I feel good. Since you convinced me to try university… I don’t know. I feel like I can do this.</em></p><p>(10:44)<strong> Moony, I’m confident you can do anything you want.</strong></p><p>(10:45) <em>Just gotta pass the exams.</em></p><p>(10:47) <strong>You’re a nerd, you’ll do fine. So will I.</strong></p><p>(10:48) <em>We’re going to be alright, aren’t we?</em></p><p>(10:48) <strong>Yeah, Moony. We’re going to be just fine.</strong></p><p> </p>

  <u>Saturday AM</u>
</p><p>(8:34) <strong>Beep beep, motherfucker!</strong></p><p>(8:34) <strong>Get your arse out here!</strong></p><p>(8:35) <em>Hey! Give me a bit!</em></p><p>(8:35) <em>Stop honking!</em></p><p>(8:36) <strong>It’s Wormtail. He had chocolate for breakfast, so now he’s on a sugar high.</strong></p><p>(8:37) <em>Damn it, Wormtail, you’ve been told!</em></p><p>(8:38) <strong>I scolded him for you. Those two aggressive beeps were his response.</strong></p><p>(8:38) <em>I’ll be two seconds, just calm down.</em></p><p>(8:39) <strong>Come on, Moony! Beep beep! Let’s go be Adults!</strong></p><p>(8:39)<em> Don’t use the A word.</em></p><p>(8:40) <strong>Then get a move on. How much stuff do you have?</strong></p><p>(8:40) <em>Gotta pack my emotional baggage. Now stop texting.</em></p><p>*</p><p>Remus looked around his empty room with a heavy sigh.</p><p>He didn’t feel anxious, not how he expected to be. He already had a feeling of homesickness, even if all of his belongings were right in front of him in bags and boxes, and his mother and father stood at the door watching him. Remus imagined that they felt worse, their only, and chronically ill, child leaving the house at just age eighteen.</p><p>Sometimes Remus wondered what kind of madness possessed him to do such a thing, but other times he heard Sirius talk on and on about what they would do in their share house, and Remus felt excited again.</p><p>“It’s alright if you change your mind,” his mother said gently. “You know Sirius and the boys will understand.”</p><p>Remus nodded silently, still looking around his old – was it old yet? – bedroom.</p><p>A buzzing came from his pocket.</p><p>(8:45) <strong>Get in loser, we’re going University-ing.</strong></p><p>He smiled, about to reply when another message came through.</p><p>(8:45) <u>Have your parents held you captive? It’s ok, we’ve already dealt with the Potters. We’re experts at this now.</u></p><p>Remus took a deep breath, then collected the bags in front of him, and asked his parents if they could take the boxes.</p><p>He wasn’t going to back out of it now.</p><p>*</p><p>Sirius was sick of the Beatles.</p><p>“Don’t you have any other artists on your phone?” he asked Peter, who was looking very constipated in the driver’s seat.</p><p>“I’ve got Rolling Stones,” he said. “I’ve also got ‘Sirius Can Fuck Off With That Face of His’.”</p><p>“And what face is that?” Sirius asked innocently, still scrolling through Peter’s phone in a desperate attempt to magically conjure up some decent music.</p><p>“The face that says everyone around you are idiots and have no taste,” Remus piped up from the backseat, bordered by bags and boxes of belongings.</p><p>Peter made eye contact with him in the rearview mirror and gave him a thumbs up.</p><p>“James would agree with me,” Sirius said petulantly. “I’ll ask him later.”</p><p>Peter slowed the car practically to a stop to turn the next corner, all three of them keeping silent as he edged the car around. He let out an audible sigh of relief when they made it, car and passengers all in tact.</p><p>“When’s he finishing with Lily’s stuff?” Peter asked once he was sure they weren’t going to get into an accident.</p><p>“He said about midday.” Sirius shrugged, then turned in the passenger seat to look at Remus. “Heard from Alice? How’s she settling in?”</p><p>“Fine,” Remus said. “She’s already getting along with her dorm mate. Emmaline. Alice says she misses having close female friends.”</p><p>Sirius nodded. “Bring her to Lily’s house warming tonight. She can meet the girls.”</p><p>Peter looked panicked. “Is that really a good idea? Alice seems like a nice, straight laced girl. No mischief.”</p><p>“Peter, when did you become such a stick in the mud?” Remus asked. He tapped Peter on the head, causing him to jump in his seat and swerve the car slightly.</p><p>“Am not!” he protested. “I’m just remembering graduation!”</p><p>“Oh, I did tell Alice about that. She thought burning ‘Class of 2014’ into the school oval was a great idea.”</p><p>Peter sighed in defeat.</p><p>“Graduation was cool,” Sirius added. “Just because you nearly caught on fire doesn’t mean it was bad for the rest of us.”</p><p>Remus hummed. “Well, that would put a damper on things.”</p><p>Sirius was about to go for another round of making fun of Peter when his phone chimed in his hand.</p><p>(9:34) Hey, nearly done with Lily. Didn’t take as long as we expected. You got Moony?</p><p>(9:34) <strong>Yeah, we got him. We’re about half an hour away.</strong></p><p>(9:35) Cool. See you soon, housemate.</p><p>(9:36) <strong>Yeah, see you soon, loser.</strong></p><p>He’d been living with James and Peter longer than he had been living with his brother by this point, but the feeling of having a place of their own filled Sirius with excitement.</p><p>Looking over his shoulder he watched Remus patiently reading GPS directions to a very frazzled Peter, a fist of apprehension clutching his heart through the excitement. He’s never lived with Remus before, so far had only spent one night over his house when they accidentally came back from an outing a bit too late. Remus had stayed at the Potter’s a few times, but with James there, it didn’t quite feel the same.</p><p>Even with them sharing the house with James and Peter, something about living with Remus without any adults – real adults – made Sirius tight with fear.</p><p>(9:44) <em>Stop freaking out, I can see it in your face.</em></p><p>(9:44) <strong>You’re meant to be reading directions.</strong></p><p>(9:45) <em>Peter thinks he knows where he’s going now.</em></p><p>(9:45) <strong>I don’t trust him.</strong></p><p>(9:45)<em> I don’t care. Stop avoiding my call out.</em></p><p>(9:46) <strong>I leave clothes all over the floor. Even in the kitchen.</strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>I know.</em></p><p>(9:47) <strong>And sometimes I snore.</strong></p><p>(9:47) <em>I know. But I’m the king of snoring.</em></p><p>(9:47) <strong>Are you sure about this?</strong></p><p>(9:48) <em>Yes, I am. Are you?</em></p><p>(9:48) <strong>Yes. Don’t leave.</strong></p><p>(9:49) <em>I’m not going to. Not even after living with you for a while.</em></p><p>(9:49) <em>Want to know a secret?</em></p><p>(9:50) <strong>What?</strong></p><p>(9:51) <em>If it was ok with you, I wasn’t really on planning to use my room.</em></p><p>(9:51) <strong>That’s 1000% fine with me.</strong></p><p>(9:52) <em>Good. Now please play something that was at least made in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</em></p><p>(9:52) <strong>Believe me, I’m trying.</strong></p><p>*</p><p>James was there before them, Lily’s place not so far from their own, and greeted them by throwing open the front door in nothing but his underwear and a blanket tied around his neck like a cape, shouting that the Marauder House was in business.</p><p>“I see that business isn’t in fashion retail,” Remus said and James scoffed at him.</p><p>“There is no use for pants in the house,” James proclaimed. “It’s the first rule on the Declaration of the Marauder House.”</p><p>“Rule number two,” Peter said quickly, “No fire!”</p><p>James came out to the car to help them unload the car, his things already thrown haphazardly into his assigned room. A box labeled ‘kitchen’ already sat on the open dining room table, courtesy of Mrs Potter, but a list on the second-hand fridge, courtesy of Mr Pettigrew, told them they still needed bathroom things. A fish bowl sat on the kitchen bench, the black fish inside swimming around happily.</p><p>“Rule number three,” James said from some room beyond, “Sirius showers last.”</p><p>“Aw, come on,” Sirius whined from somewhere else. “Fine, rule number four: James can’t wear my shirts anymore.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Remus shouted from the living room. “Those are mine now!”</p><p>There was a loud bang, like something was dropped onto the floorboards, Peter’s tiny voice cursing from the smallest bedroom.</p><p>“What am I supposed to wear, then?” James asked when he emerged from his bedroom.</p><p>“What you’ve got on now is fine,” Remus told him. “Rule number five: no one is allowed to catch a cold.”</p><p>James nodded. “My immune system is too strong, anyway. No problem.”</p><p>“Rub salt into my wounds, why don’t you,” Remus teased.</p><p>James had hired a truck the day before so they could transport all of their furniture, so there wasn’t much to be done besides each of their rooms and the kitchen. They pooled whatever money they currently had on them to buy food for the day, and some towels at Sirius’ insistence, and by the late afternoon James and Peter were out buying groceries while Sirius and Remus finished up in the kitchen.</p><p>“I like Mrs Potter’s confidence in us to eat a vegetable,” Sirius said, holding up a potato peeler.</p><p>“I like her confidence in us to live alone at all,” Remus said quite honestly.</p><p>Sirius threw the potato peeler into the second drawer, thus far labeled with a sticky note as the ‘don’t know where else it would go’ drawer, and drew nearer to where Remus was working on the ceramic plates.</p><p>“Don’t tickle me,” Remus warned as he put in a stack of plates.</p><p>“I would never,” he even said as he wrapped his arms around Remus’ waist.</p><p>Remus snorted. “You would so.”</p><p>“You nearly done?” Sirius pressed his cold nose into the crook of Remus’ neck, making him squirm and nearly drop a bowl.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Good. We need to christen the bed.”</p><p>“I hope by that you mean we need to sleep in it.”</p><p>“Duh,” Sirius sighed. “I was awake at seven this morning. I never want to do that again.”</p><p>“Remember when you were in boarding school?” Remus said.</p><p>“I only remember the things that happened after ten in the morning. Now come on, you’re taking too long.” Sirius started tugging on Remus’ jumper, slowly pulling him backwards into the room originally pegged to be Sirius’. Remus’ clothes were packed away in the room over, but his books were on the bookshelf next to Sirius’ books, and his telescope sat in the corner of the room next to Sirius’ latest building project, which Remus still didn’t know the function of.</p><p>Sirius collapsed on the roughly made bed, rolling over to one side to let Remus slide on. Remus crawled in close, head on Sirius’ chest as he instantly felt the pull of sleep try to drag him.</p><p>“This was a good idea,” Remus said sleepily, feeling those hooks of unconsciousness deepen as Sirius ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>“T’was,” Sirius agreed, sounding just as tired. “I had a lot of good ideas this year.”</p><p>“So did I, I think.”</p><p>“Tell me one.”</p><p>Remus lifted his head to kiss the exposed skin above Sirius’ shirt neck, pulling himself to practically lie on top of Sirius and continue to kiss his throat.</p><p>“Loving you was a good idea,” Remus said. He didn’t feel as scared as he thought he should, saying that for the first time, but instead felt a rush of new adrenaline.</p><p>He felt that spike again when Sirius whispered, “I love you too,” before his body crashed and he fell asleep, Sirius joining him seconds after.</p><p>*</p><p>
